"1" "THREEPIO" "Did you hear that? They shut down the main reactor. We will be destroyed for sure. This is crazy!"
"2" "THREEPIO" "We are doomed!"
"3" "THREEPIO" "There will be no escape for the princess this time."
"4" "THREE" "What is this?"
"5" "THREEPIO" "I should know better than to trust the logic of a medium-sized thermocapsular housing removal wizard..."
"6" "LUKE" "Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Hurry up!"
"7" "THREEPIO" "Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
"8" "THREEPIO" "Finally! Where have you been?"
"9" "THREEPIO" "They're heading this way. What are we going to do? We're going to be sent to the Kessel spice mines or crushed who knows what!"
"10" "THREE" "Wait a minute, where are you going?"
"11" "IMPERIAL OFFICER" "The Death Star plans are not in the main computer."
"12" "VADER" "Where are the transmissions you intercepted?"
"13" "REBEL OFFICER" "We didn't intercept any transmissions. Aaah... This is a consular ship. We were on a diplomatic mission."
"14" "VADER" "If this is a consular ship... where is the ambassador?"
"15" "VADER" "Commander, destroy this ship until you find these plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want him alive!"
"16" "TROOPER" "There she is! Ready to stun!"
"17" "TROOPER" "She will be fine. Inform Lord Vader that we have a prisoner."
"18" "THREEPIO" "Hey, you're not allowed in there. It's restricted. You'll be deactivated for sure.."
"19" "THREE" "Don't call me a stupid philosopher, you fat bastard! Now get out before anyone sees you."
"20" "THREEPIO" "Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not going in there!"
"21" "THREEPIO" "I'm going to regret this."
"22" "CHIEF PILOT" "Here goes another one."
"23" "CAPTAIN" "Hold your fire. There are no life forms. Must have been short circuited."
"24" "THREEPIO" "That's funny, the damage doesn't look so bad from here."
"25" "THREEPIO" "Are you sure these things are safe?"
"26" "Woman" "I told you to slow down!"
"27" "FIXER" "Did I hear a young noise go off around here?"
"28" "CAMIE" "It was just Wormie in another attack."
"29" "LUKE" "Shape yourselves up!... Biggs?"
"30" "LUKE" "I didn't know you were back! When did you come in?"
"31" "BIGGS" "Just now. I wanted to surprise you, big shot. I thought you'd be here... I certainly didn't expect you to be working."
"32" "LUKE" "The Academy hasn't changed you much... but you're back so soon? Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?"
"33" "BIGGS" "Of course I understand. I signed on board the Rand Ecliptic last week. First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service... I just got back to say goodbye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons."
"34" "LUKE" "I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our system. Come and look!"
"35" "DEAK" "Not again! Forget it."
"36" "LUKE" "There they are!"
"37" "BIGGS" "This isn't a battle, sniper... they're just sitting there! Probably a resupply from a tanker freighter."
"38" "LUKE" "But there were a lot of shots before..."
"39" "LUKE" "Hey, take it easy..."
"40" "CAMIE" "Don't worry about it, Wormie."
"41" "FIXER" "I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I doubt the Empire would fight to maintain this system. Believe me Luke, this planet is a big chunk of nothing..."
"42" "READ" "Lord Vader, I should know. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate won't stand by this when they hear you attacked a diplomat..."
"43" "VADER" "Don't play with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mission of mercy this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were sent to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened with the plans they sent you."
"44" "READ" "I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan..."
"45" "VADER" "You are part of the Rebel Alliance... and a traitor. Take her away!"
"46" "COMMANDER" "Holding it is dangerous. If word gets out, it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the Senate."
"47" "VADER" "I tracked the Rebel spies to her. Now she's my only link to finding their secret base!"
"48" "COMMANDER" "you whatever."
"49" "VADER" "Leave it to me. Send a distress signal and then report to the Senate that everyone on board has been killed!"
"50" "SECOND OFFICER" "Lord Vader, battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was jettisoned during the fight, but no life forms were aboard."
"51" "VADER" "She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment to retrieve them. Handle it personally, Commander. There will be no one to stop us this time."
"52" "COMMANDER" "Yes, sir."
"53" "THREEPIO" "How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. It seems we are made to suffer. It's our lot in life."
"54" "THREEPIO" "I have to rest before I collapse. My joints are almost frozen."
"55" "THREEPIO" "What a desolate place this is."
"56" "THREEPIO" "Where are you going?"
"57" "THREEPIO" "Well, I'm not going that way. It's too rocky. It's much easier this way."
"58" "THREEPIO" "What makes you think there are settlements there?"
"59" "THREEPIO" "Don't get technical with me."
"60" "THREEPIO" "What mission? What are you talking about? I've had enough of you! Go that way! You'll be out of order in a day, you shortsighted pile of scrap!"
"61" "THREEPIO" "And don't let me catch you following me around begging for help, because you won't get it."
"62" "THREEPIO" "No more adventures. I'm not going there."
"63" "THREEPIO" "That defective idiot. This is all his fault! He tricked me into going this way, but he won't do any better."
"64" "THREEPIO" "Wait, what is this? A transport! I'm saved!"
"65" "THREEPIO" "Here! Help! Please help!"
"66" "LUKE" "...so I cut my power, turned off the afterburners and got into Deak's wake. I was so close I thought I was going to fry my instruments. Really bad Skyhopper. Uncle Owen was very upset. He grounded me for the rest of the season. You should have been there...it was fantastic."
"67" "BIGGS" "You should take it easy Luke. You might be the hottest pilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, wammo, you'll be nothing more than a dark stain on the underside of a canyon wall."
"68" "LUKE" "Look who's talking. Now that you've been around these giant ships, you're starting to sound like my uncle. You've gone soft in the city..."
"69" "BIGGS" "I missed you kid."
"70" "LUKE" "Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's been so... quiet."
"71" "BIGGS" "Luke, I didn't come back just to say goodbye... I shouldn't tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust... and if I don't come back, I want someone know."
"72" "LUKE" "What are you talking about?"
"73" "BIGGS" "I made some friends at the Academy... when our frigate goes to one of the core systems, we'll jump ship and join the Alliance..."
"74" "LUKE" "Join the Rebellion?! You're kidding! How?"
"75" "BIGGS" "Calm down! You have a mouth bigger than a meteor crater!"
"76" "LUKE" "Sorry. I'm quiet. Listen to how quiet I am. You can barely hear me..."
"77" "BIGGS" "My friend has a friend at Bestine who can help us make contact."
"78" "LUKE" "always trying to find them."
"79" "BIGGS" "I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them, I'll do what I can on my own... It's what we've always talked about. Luke, I'm not going to wait for the Empire to put me in trouble. service. The Rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the right side - the side I believe in."
"80" "LUKE" "And I'm stuck here..."
"81" "BIGGS" "I thought you were going to the Academy next semester. You'll have a chance to climb out of this rock."
"82" "LUKE" "Not likely! I had to cancel my membership. There's been a lot of unrest among the Sand People since you left... they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead."
"83" "BIGGS" "Your uncle could stop an entire colony of Sand People with a blaster."
"84" "LUKE" "I know, but he's got enough vaporizers to make the place worth it. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now."
"85" "BIGGS" "I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems important or what really is important. What's the point of all your uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?... You know that they are beginning to nationalize commerce in the central systems... it won't be long before your uncle is just a tenant, slaving away for the greater glory of the Empire.
"86" "LUKE" "It couldn't happen here. You said so yourself. The Empire won't bother with that rock."
"87" "BIGGS" "Things always change."
"88" "LUKE" "I'd like to go... Are you going to stay here long?"
"89" "BIGGS" "No, I'm leaving in the morning..."
"90" "LUKE" "Then I guess I won't see you."
"91" "BIGGS" "Maybe one day... I'll keep an eye out."
"92" "LUKE" "Well, I'll be at the Academy next season... after that who knows. I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet, that's for sure... Take care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I have I have."
"93" "BIGGS" "See you later, Luke."
"94" "THREEPIO" "Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!"
"95" "FIRST TROOPER" "Someone was in the capsule. The tracks go in this direction."
"96" "SECOND SOLDIER" "Look, sir - droids."
"97" "THREEPIO" "Wake up! Wake up!"
"98" "THREEPIO" "We are doomed."
"99" "THREEPIO" "Do you think they're going to melt us?"
"100" "THREEPIO" "Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this ever end?"
"101" "BERU" "Luke, tell Owen if he can get a translator to make sure he speaks bocce ball."
"102" "LUKE" "Looks like we don't have much of a choice, but I'll remind you."
"103" "OWEN" "I don't need a protocol droid."
"104" "THREEPIO" "Sir - not in an environment like this - that is why I have also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that..."
"105" "OWEN" "What I really need is a droid that understands the binary languages ​​of moisture vaporizers."
"106" "THREEPIO" "Vaporizers! Sir - My first job was programming binary freight elevators... very similar to your vaporizers. You could say..."
"107" "OWEN" "Do you speak bocce?"
"108" "THREEPIO" "Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language to me... I'm so fluent in bocce..."
"109" "OWEN" "Alright; shut up! I'll take this one."
"110" "THREEPIO" "Shut up, sir."
"111" "OWEN" "Luke, take these two to the garage, will you? I want you to clean them both up before dinner."
"112" "LUKE" "But I was going into Toshi Station to get some power converters..."
"113" "OWEN" "You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now, come on, get to work!"
"114" "LUKE" "Alright, let's go! And Red, let's go. Well, come on, Red, let's go."
"115" "LUKE" "Uncle Owen..."
"116" "OWEN" "Yes?"
"117" "LUKE" "This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!"
"118" "OWEN" "Hey, what are you trying to push on us?"
"119" "THREEPIO" "Excuse me, sir, but this R2 unit is in excellent condition. A real bargain."
"120" "LUKE" "Uncle Owen..."
"121" "OWEN" "Yes?"
"122" "LUKE" "And that one?"
"123" "OWEN" "And that blue one? Let's take that one."
"124" "LUKE" "Yeah, take it off."
"125" "THREEPIO" "Uh, I'm sure you'll be very pleased with this, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes."
"126" "LUKE" "Okay, let's go."
"127" "THREEPIO" "Now, don't forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is far beyond my ability!"
"128" "THREEPIO" "Thanks to the manufacturer! This oil bath is going to be so good. I have such a bad case of dust contamination I can barely move!"
"129" "LUKE" "It's not fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never getting out of here!"
"130" "THREEPIO" "Is there anything I can do to help?"
"131" "LUKE" "Well, unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me out of this rock!"
"132" "THREEPIO" "I don't think so, sir. I'm just a droid and I don't have much knowledge about such things. Not on this planet, anyway. In fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on."
"133" "LUKE" "Well, if there's a bright center in the universe, you're on the farthest planet."
"134" "THREEPIO" "I understand, sir."
"135" "LUKE" "Uh, you can call me Luke."
"136" "THREEPIO" "I understand, Mr. Luke."
"137" "LUKE" "Just Luke."
"138" "THREEPIO" "And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo."
"139" "LUKE" "Hello."
"140" "LUKE" "You've got a lot of carbon score here. Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action."
"141" "THREEPIO" "With everything we've been through, sometimes I'm surprised we're in as good a condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and everything."
"142" "LUKE" "Do you know about the Rebellion against the Empire?"
"143" "THREEPIO" "That's how we came into your service, if you know what I mean, sir."
"144" "LUKE" "Have you been in many battles?"
"145" "THREEPIO" "Several, I think. There really isn't much to tell. I'm not much more than an interpreter, and I'm not very good at telling stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyway. anyway."
"146" "LUKE" "Well, my little friend, you've got something pretty good here. Were you on a star cruiser or..."
"147" "READ" "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope."
"148" "LUKE" "What is this?"
"149" "THREEPIO" "What is what?!? He asked you a question... What is this?"
"150" "READ" "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope."
"151" "THREEPIO" "Ah, he says it's nothing, sir. Just a malfunction. Old data. Don't pay attention to it."
"152" "LUKE" "Who is she? She's beautiful."
"153" "THREEPIO" "I guess I'm not sure, sir."
"154" "READ" "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
"155" "THREEPIO" "I believe she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir - I believe. Our captain was connected with..."
"156" "LUKE" "Is there anything else on this recording?"
"157" "THREEPIO" "Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us into trouble. It's okay, you can trust him. He's our new master."
"158" "THREEPIO" "He says it's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident around here. And it's a private message for him. Frankly, sir, I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles , but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric."
"159" "LUKE" "Obi-Wan Kenobi? Does he mean old Ben Kenobi?"
"160" "THREEPIO" "Excuse me, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?"
"161" "LUKE" "Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a weird old hermit."
"162" "LUKE" "I wonder who she is. It looks like she's in trouble. I'd better replay the whole thing."
"163" "THREEPIO" "He says that the restraining screw caused a short circuit in his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the screw, he will be able to play the entire recording."
"164" "LUKE" "Hm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away from me if I take it off! Okay."
"165" "LUKE" "There it is."
"166" "LUKE" "Well, wait a minute. Where did she go? Bring her back! Play the entire message."
"167" "THREEPIO" "I'm playing. What are you carrying inside your rusty guts!"
"168" "AUNT BERU" "Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!"
"169" "LUKE" "Okay, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru."
"170" "THREEPIO" "I'm sorry, sir, but he seems to have picked up a slight vibration."
"171" "LUKE" "Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back."
"172" "THREEPIO" "Just reconsider throwing that message at him."
"173" "THREEPIO" "No, I don't think he likes you at all."
"174" "THREEPIO" "No, I don't like you either."
"175" "LUKE" "You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen."
"176" "OWEN" "What makes you think that?"
"177" "LUKE" "Well, I found a recording while I was cleaning him. It says it belongs to someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi."
"178" "LUKE" "I thought he might be referring to Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben."
"179" "OWEN" "That old man is just a crazy wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory wiped. That will be the end of it. It belongs to us now."
"180" "LUKE" "But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for you?"
"181" "OWEN" "He won't, I don't think he exists anymore. He died about the same time as your father."
"182" "LUKE" "Did he know my father?"
"183" "OWEN" "I told you to forget it. Your only concern is getting the new droids ready for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the South Summit working on those capacitors."
"184" "LUKE" "Yes, sir. I think these new droids are going to work out well. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our deal about me staying on for another season. And if these new droids work out, I want to broadcast my application to the Academy this year."
"185" "OWEN" "You mean the next semester before the harvest?"
"186" "LUKE" "Of course, there are more than enough droids."
"187" "OWEN" "The harvest is when I need you most. Just one more season. This year we'll do enough at the harvest so I can hire a few more hands. And then you can go to the Academy the year he comes."
"188" "OWEN" "You must understand that I need you here, Luke."
"189" "LUKE" "But it's a whole year."
"190" "OWEN" "Look, it's just one more season."
"191" "LUKE" "Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left."
"192" "AUNT BERU" "Where are you going?"
"193" "LUKE" "Looks like I'm not going anywhere. I have to finish cleaning these droids."
"194" "AUNT BERU" "Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends are gone. It means a lot to him."
"195" "OWEN" "I'll make it up to him next year. I promise."
"196" "AUNT BERU" "Luke's not a farmer, Owen. He's got too much of his father in him."
"197" "OWEN" "That's what I'm afraid of."
"198" "LUKE" "What are you doing hiding there?"
"199" "THREEPIO" "It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, faulty; he kept babbling about his mission."
"200" "LUKE" "Oh no!"
"201" "THREEPIO" "That R2 unit has always been a problem. Those astrodroids are getting out of control. Even I can't understand their logic sometimes."
"202" "LUKE" "How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Damn!"
"203" "THREEPIO" "Forgive me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?"
"204" "LUKE" "It's too dangerous with all the Sand People around. We'll have to wait until morning."
"205" "OWEN" "Luke, I'm turning off the power tonight."
"206" "LUKE" "Alright, I'll be there in a few minutes. Dude, I'll get it."
"207" "LUKE" "You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble."
"208" "THREEPIO" "Oh, he's excellent at that, sir."
"209" "OWEN" "Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loitering right now!"
"210" "OWEN" "Did you see Luke this morning?"
"211" "AUNT BERU" "He said he had some things to do before starting today, so he left early."
"212" "OWEN" "Uh? He took those two new droids with him?"
"213" "AUNT BERU" "I think so."
"214" "OWEN" "Well, he better have those units in the south lane repaired by noon or there's going to be hell to pay!"
"215" "LUKE" "What do you mean."
"216" "LUKE" "Old Ben Kenobi lives this way somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have gotten this far. We must have lost him. Uncle Owen won't take it very well. ."
"217" "THREEPIO" "Sir, it would help if you told him it was my fault."
"218" "LUKE" "Of course. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or two..."
"219" "THREEPIO" "Disable! Well, on the other hand, if you hadn't removed its retaining screw..."
"220" "LUKE" "Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... stepped on the gas."
"221" "LUKE" "Hey, wow, where do you think you're going?"
"222" "THREEPIO" "Master Luke here is your rightful owner. Let's not have any more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi nonsense... and don't talk to me about your mission either. You're lucky he doesn't blow you up in a million pieces right here."
"223" "LUKE" "Well, come on. It's getting late. I just hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really explodes."
"224" "THREEPIO" "If you don't mind me saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you get him back to your workshop."
"225" "LUKE" "No, he won't try anything."
"226" "LUKE" "What's wrong with him now?"
"227" "THREEPIO" "Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast."
"228" "LUKE" "Sand Person! Or worse! Come on, let's take a look. Let's go."
"229" "LUKE" "There are two Banthas down there, but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sand People. I can see one of them now."
"230" "BEN" "Hello! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid."
"231" "BEN" "Don't worry, he'll be fine."
"232" "LUKE" "What happened?"
"233" "BEN" "Rest up son, you've had a busy day. You're lucky you're still in one piece."
"234" "LUKE" "Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!"
"235" "BEN" "The Jundland Wastes are not to be traversed lightly. Tell me, young Luke, what brings you here?"
"236" "LUKE" "Ah, this little droid! I think he's looking for his old master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... it seems there's no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?"
"237" "BEN" "Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? That's a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time."
"238" "LUKE" "I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead."
"239" "BEN" "Oh, he's not dead, no... not yet."
"240" "LUKE" "You know him!"
"241" "BEN" "Well, of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't used the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born."
"242" "LUKE" "Then the droid belongs to you."
"243" "BEN" "I don't remember ever having a droid. Very interesting..."
"244" "BEN" "I think we better go inside. The Sand People are easily scared, but they will soon be back and in greater numbers."
"245" "LUKE" "...Threepio!"
"246" "THREEPIO" "Where am I? I must have made a bad move..."
"247" "LUKE" "Can you stand? We have to get out of here before the Sand People return."
"248" "THREEPIO" "I don't think I can make it. Keep going, Master Luke. There's no point in you putting yourself at risk for my sake. I'm finished."
"249" "LUKE" "No, you're not. What kind of talk is this?"
"250" "BEN" "Quick, son... they're on the move."
"251" "LUKE" "No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter."
"252" "BEN" "That's what your uncle told you. He didn't stick to his father's ideals. I thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved."
"253" "LUKE" "Did you fight in the Clone Wars?"
"254" "BEN" "Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight just like your father."
"255" "LUKE" "I wish I had met him."
"256" "BEN" "He was the best star pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand that you also became a good pilot. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me..."
"257" "BEN" "I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have it when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He was afraid you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damn idiotic idealistic crusade like your father did."
"258" "THREEPIO" "Sir, if you won't need me, I'll close up for a while."
"259" "LUKE" "Sure, go ahead."
"260" "LUKE" "What is it?"
"261" "BEN" "Your father's lightsaber. This is a Jedi Knight's weapon. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster."
"262" "BEN" "An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For more than a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire."
"263" "LUKE" "How did my father die?"
"264" "BEN" "A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was my pupil until he turned evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered his father. Now the Jedi are anything but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force."
"265" "LUKE" "The Force?"
"266" "BEN" "Well, the Force is what gives the Jedi their power. It is an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It unites the galaxy."
"267" "BEN" "Now, let's see if we can't find out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from."
"268" "LUKE" "I saw part of the message that he was..."
"269" "BEN" "Looks like I found it."
"270" "READ" "General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his fight against the Empire. I regret that I cannot present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I fear that my mission to bring him to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion in the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to recover You must deliver this droid safely to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you are my only hope."
"271" "BEN" "You must learn the ways of the Force if you want to come with me to Alderaan."
"272" "LUKE" "Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I have to go home. It's late, I'm ready for it."
"273" "BEN" "I need your help, Luke. I'm getting too old for this kind of thing. She needs your help."
"274" "LUKE" "I can't get involved! I have work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it now. It's a long way from here."
"275" "BEN" "It's your uncle speaking."
"276" "LUKE" "Oh, God, my uncle. How am I supposed to explain this?"
"277" "BEN" "Learn about the Force, Luke."
"278" "LUKE" "Look, I can take you to Anchorhead. You can take a shuttle there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going."
"279" "BEN" "You must do what you think is right, of course."
"280" "TAGGE" "Until this battle station is fully operational, we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is very well equipped. They are more dangerous than you realize."
"281" "MOTTI" "Dangerous to your Starfleet, Commander; not to this battle station!"
"282" "TAGGE" "The Rebellion will continue to gain support in the Imperial Senate as long as..."
"283" "TARKIN" "The Imperial Senate will no longer be a concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away."
"284" "TAGGE" "That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without bureaucracy?"
"285" "TARKIN" "Regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep local systems in line. Fear of this battle station."
"286" "TAGGE" "What about the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, though unlikely, that they will find a weakness and exploit it."
"287" "VADER" "The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands."
"288" "MOTTI" "Any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a futile gesture, no matter what technical data they have obtained. This station is now the supreme power of the universe. I suggest we use it!"
"289" "VADER" "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've built. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant compared to the power of the Force."
"290" "MOTTI" "Do not try to frighten us with your sorcerer ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion did not help you conjure up the stolen data tapes, nor did it give you enough clairvoyance to find the Rebel's hideout. strong..."
"291" "VADER" "I find your lack of faith disturbing."
"292" "TARKIN" "Enough of this! Vader, let him go!"
"293" "VADER" "As you wish."
"294" "TARKIN" "This fight is futile. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel stronghold when this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift blow."
"295" "LUKE" "Looks like the Sand People did it, all right. Look, here are gaffes, bantha tracks. It's just... I've never heard of them hitting something this big before."
"296" "BEN" "They didn't. But we must think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sand People always walk in single file to hide their numbers."
"297" "LUKE" "These are the same Jawas that sold Artoo and Threepio to us."
"298" "BEN" "And those blast points, too accurate for the Sand People. Only Imperial storm troopers are so accurate."
"299" "LUKE" "Why do Imperial troops want to kill Jawas?"
"300" "LUKE" "If they tracked the robots here, they might have found out who they sold them to. And that would get them back home!"
"301" "BEN" "Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous."
"302" "LUKE" "Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!"
"303" "VADER" "And now, Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base."
"304" "BEN" "There's nothing you could have done, Luke, if you were there. You would have been killed too, and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire."
"305" "LUKE" "I want to go with you to Alderaan. There is nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father."
"306" "BEN" "Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious."
"307" "TROOPER" "How long have you had these droids?"
"308" "LUKE" "About three or four seasons."
"309" "BEN" "They're for sale if you want them."
"310" "SOLDIER" "Let me see your ID."
"311" "BEN" "You don't need to see his ID."
"312" "TROOPER" "We don't need to see his identification."
"313" "BEN" "searching."
"314" "TROOPER" "These are not the droids we are looking for."
"315" "BEN" "He can handle his business."
"316" "TROOPER" "You can go about your business."
"317" "BEN" "Go ahead."
"318" "TROOPER" "Go ahead. Go ahead."
"319" "THREEPIO" "I can't stand those Jawas. Disgusting creatures."
"320" "LUKE" "Keep going, keep going. I can't understand how we got past those soldiers. I thought we were dead."
"321" "BEN" "The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You will find it a powerful ally."
"322" "LUKE" "Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here who will take us to Alderaan?"
"323" "BEN" "Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Just be careful. This place can be a little difficult."
"324" "LUKE" "I'm ready for anything."
"325" "THREEPIO" "Come on, Artoo."
"326" "BARTENDER" "We don't serve their kind here!"
"327" "LUKE" "What?"
"328" "BARTENDER" "You droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want them here."
"329" "LUKE" "Listen, why don't you wait by the speeder. We don't want any trouble."
"330" "THREEPIO" "I completely agree with you, sir."
"331" "CREATURE" "Negola dewaghi lumberjack?!?"
"332" "HUMAN" "He doesn't like you."
"333" "LUKE" "I'm sorry."
"334" "HUMAN" "I don't like you either"
"335" "HUMAN" "Don't insult us. Just watch yourself. We are wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems."
"336" "LUKE" "I'll be careful what."
"337" "HUMAN" "You will be dead."
"338" "BEN" "This little one isn't worth the effort. Come, let me buy you something..."
"339" "BARTENDER" "No detonators! No detonators!"
"340" "BEN" "This is Chewbacca. He's a first mate on a ship that can meet our needs."
"341" "THREEPIO" "I don't like the look of this."
"342" "HAN" "Han Solo. I'm the captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system."
"343" "BEN" "Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship."
"344" "HAN" "Fast ship? Have you never heard of the Millennium Falcon?"
"345" "BEN" "Should it have?"
"346" "HAN" "It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve parsecs!"
"347" "HAN" "I outpaced the Imperial ships, not the local cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the payload?"
"348" "BEN" "Passengers only. Me, the boy, two droids, and no questions."
"349" "HAN" "What is it? Some kind of local problem?"
"350" "BEN" "Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial involvement."
"351" "HAN" "Well, that's the real trick, isn't it? And it'll cost you something extra. Ten thousand up front."
"352" "LUKE" "Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!"
"353" "HAN" "But who's going to drive, boy! You?"
"354" "LUKE" "You bet I could. I'm not that bad of a pilot! We don't have to sit here and listen..."
"355" "BEN" "We don't have much with us. But we can pay you two thousand now, fifteen more when we get to Alderaan."
"356" "HAN" "Seventeen, huh!"
"357" "HAN" "Okay. You guys got a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're ready. Dock 94."
"358" "BEN" "Ninety-four."
"359" "HAN" "It looks like someone is starting to take an interest in your work."
"360" "TROOPER" "Alright, let's check."
"361" "HAN" "Seventeen thousand! These guys must be really desperate. This could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get it ready."
"362" "BEN" "You're going to have to sell your speeder."
"363" "LUKE" "It's okay. I'm never going back to this planet again."
"364" "GREEDO" "Going somewhere, Solo?"
"365" "HAN" "Yes, Greedo. Actually, I was going to see your boss. Tell Jabba I have his money."
"366" "GREEDO" "It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the chance. Jabba has put a price on your head, so big that every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I found you first."
"367" "HAN" "Yes, but this time I got the money."
"368" "GREEDO" "If you give it to me, I might forget I ever found you."
"369" "HAN" "I don't have that on me. Tell Jabba..."
"370" "GREEDO" "Jabba is through with you. He has no time for smugglers who drop off their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser."
"371" "HAN" "Even I get approached sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?"
"372" "GREEDO" "You can tell Jabba that. He can only take your ship."
"373" "HAN" "Over my dead body."
"374" "GREEDO" "That's the idea I've been looking forward to killing you for a long time."
"375" "HAN" "Yeah, I bet so."
"376" "HAN" "Sorry for the mess."
"377" "VADER" "Her resistance to the mental probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her."
"378" "IMPERIAL OFFICER" "Final checkout is complete. All systems are operational. What course should we set?"
"379" "TARKIN" "Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion."
"380" "VADER" "What do you mean?"
"381" "TARKIN" "I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan."
"382" "TROOPER" "With pleasure."
"383" "THREEPIO" "Lock the door, Artoo."
"384" "TROOPER" "Alright, check that side of the street. It's safe. Go to the next door."
"385" "THREEPIO" "I would rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault."
"386" "THREEPIO" "Watch your language!"
"387" "LUKE" "He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out, they"
"388" "BEN" "That will be enough."
"389" "BEN" "If the ship is as fast as he's boasting, we should do well."
"390" "JABBA" "Come on, Solo!"
"391" "HAN" "I've been waiting for you, Jabba."
"392" "JABBA" "I hoped you would."
"393" "HAN" "I'm not the running type."
"394" "JABBA" "Han, my boy, there are times when you disappoint me... why didn't you pay me? And why did you have to fry poor Greedo like that... after everything we've been through together ."
"395" "HAN" "You sent Greedo to blow me up."
"396" "JABBA" "Han, because you're the best smuggler in the business. You're too valuable to fry. He was just conveying my concern about your delays. He wasn't going to blow you up."
"397" "HAN" "I guess he thought so. Next time don't send one of those idiots. If you have something to tell me, come see me yourself."
"398" "JABBA" "Han, Han! If only you didn't have to dump that shipment of spices... you understand I can't make an exception. Your shipment at the first sign of an Imperial ship? Not a good business."
"399" "HAN" "You know, even I get shipped sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice, but I have a letter now and I can pay you back, plus some more. I just need some more time ."
"400" "JABBA" "Put away your blasters. Han, my boy, I'm only doing this because you're the best and I need you. So for an extra, say... twenty percent I'll give you some more time... but that's it, if you disappoint me again, I will put such a high price on your head that you won't be able to approach a civilized system for the rest of your short life."
"401" "HAN" "Jabba, I'm going to pay you because it's my pleasure."
"402" "LUKE" "What rubbish."
"403" "HAN" "She'll go point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's where it counts, kid. I added some special modifications myself."
"404" "HAN" "We're a little rushed, so if you hurry on board, we'll get out of here."
"405" "THREEPIO" "Hello, sir."
"406" "SOLDIER" "Which way?"
"407" "SOLDIER" "All right, men. Load your weapons!"
"408" "SOLDIER" "Stop that ship!"
"409" "SOLDIER" "Finish them!"
"410" "HAN" "Chewie, get us out of here!"
"411" "THREEPIO" "Oh, my. I had forgotten how much I hate space travel."
"412" "HAN" "Looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter than I thought. Try to hold them off. Tilt the deflector shield while I do the calculations for the jump to light speed."
"413" "HAN" "Stay tuned! There are two more coming; they're going to try to cut us off."
"414" "LUKE" "Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was fast."
"415" "HAN" "Watch your mouth, kid, or you'll find yourself floating home. We'll be safe enough when we make the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I know some maneuvers. We'll lose them!"
"416" "HAN" "This is where the fun begins!"
"417" "BEN" "How long before you can make the jump to light speed?"
"418" "HAN" "It will take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navigation computer."
"419" "LUKE" "Are you kidding? At the rate they're winning..."
"420" "HAN" "Traveling through hyperspace isn't like clearing crops, boy! Without precise calculations, we could fly right through a star or jump too close to a supernova and that would end your trip pretty quickly, wouldn't it?"
"421" "LUKE" "What's that flashing?"
"422" "HAN" "We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap in, I'll jump to light speed."
"423" "MOTTI" "We have entered the Alderaan system."
"424" "READ" "Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding Vader's collar. I recognized his stench when I was brought aboard."
"425" "TARKIN" "Charming to the end. You don't know how difficult I found it to sign the order to end your life!"
"426" "READ" "take responsibility yourself!"
"427" "TARKIN" "Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No star system will dare oppose the Emperor now."
"428" "READ" "The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers."
"429" "TARKIN" "Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that will be destroyed first. Since you are reluctant to give us the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test the power destructive of this season... on his home planet of Alderaan."
"430" "READ" "No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't..."
"431" "TARKIN" "Would you prefer another target? A military target? Then name the system!"
"432" "TARKIN" "I'm tired of asking this. Then it will be the last time. Where is the Rebel base?"
"433" "READ" "Dantooine."
"434" "READ" "They're on Dantooine."
"435" "TARKIN" "Over there. You see Lord Vader, she may be reasonable. Continue with the operation. You may fire when you are ready."
"436" "READ" "What?"
"437" "TARKIN" "You're being too trusting. Dantooine is too far away to make an effective demonstration. But don't worry. We'll deal with your rebel friends soon."
"438" "READ" "No!"
"439" "VADER" "Start primary ignition."
"440" "LUKE" "Are you okay? What's wrong?"
"441" "BEN" "I felt a great disturbance in the Force... as if millions of voices suddenly screamed in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened."
"442" "BEN" "You'd better get on with your exercises."
"443" "HAN" "Well, you can forget your problems with those imperial slugs. I told you I would get over them."
"444" "HAN" "Not everyone thanks me at once."
"445" "HAN" "Anyway, we should be on Alderaan in about oh-two hundred hours."
"446" "THREEPIO" "Now be careful, Artoo."
"447" "THREEPIO" "He made a fair play. Yelling about it won't help you."
"448" "HAN" "Let him have it. It's not wise to disturb a Wookiee."
"449" "THREEPIO" "But sir, no one cares about disturbing a droid."
"450" "HAN" "That's because droids don't take people's arms off when they lose. Wookiees have been known to do that."
"451" "THREEPIO" "I understand, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win."
"452" "BEN" "Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him."
"453" "LUKE" "You mean you control your actions?"
"454" "BEN" "Partially. But it also obeys your commands."
"455" "HAN" "Hypocritical religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, boy."
"456" "LUKE" "You don't believe in the Force, do you?"
"457" "HAN" "Boy, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange things, but I've never seen anything that makes me believe that there is an all-powerful force controlling everything. There is no field of mystical energy that controls my destiny."
"458" "HAN" "It's all a bunch of simple, meaningless tricks."
"459" "BEN" "I suggest you try again, Luke."
"460" "BEN" "This time, let go of your conscious self and act on instinct."
"461" "LUKE" "With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am I supposed to fight?"
"462" "BEN" "Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them."
"463" "BEN" "Stretch with your feelings."
"464" "BEN" "You see, you can do this."
"465" "HAN" "I call it luck."
"466" "BEN" "In my experience, luck doesn't exist."
"467" "HAN" "Look, doing well against remotes is one thing. Doing well against the living? That's another thing."
"468" "HAN" "Looks like we're arriving at Alderaan."
"469" "LUKE" "You know, I felt something. I could almost see the remote."
"470" "BEN" "That's good. You've taken your first step into a bigger world."
"471" "TARKIN" "Yes."
"472" "OFFICER CASS" "Our scout ships have arrived on Dantooine. They have found the remains of a rebel base, but estimate it has been deserted for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the surrounding systems."
"473" "TARKIN" "She lied! She lied to us!"
"474" "VADER" "I told her she would never knowingly betray the Rebellion."
"475" "TARKIN" "Finish her...immediately!"
"476" "HAN" "Hold on, Chewie, here we go. Shut down the sublight engines."
"477" "HAN" "What...? Ah, we went out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts."
"478" "LUKE" "What's going on?"
"479" "HAN" "Our position is correct, except... no, Alderaan!"
"480" "LUKE" "What do you mean? Where is it?"
"481" "HAN" "That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It's not there. It's been totally blown up."
"482" "LUKE" "What? How?"
"483" "BEN" "Destroyed... by the Empire!"
"484" "HAN" "The entire Starfleet couldn't destroy the entire planet. It would take a thousand ships with more firepower than me..."
"486" "LUKE" "Maybe they know what happened."
"485" "HAN" "There's another ship arriving."
"487" "BEN" "It's an Imperial fighter."
"488" "LUKE" "He followed us!"
"489" "BEN" "No. It's a short-range fighter."
"490" "HAN" "There's no base around here. Where did it come from?"
"491" "LUKE" "It's definitely leaving in a hurry. If they spot us, we're in trouble."
"492" "HAN" "Not if I can help it. Chewie... jam your transmissions."
"493" "BEN" "It would be better to let him go. He's too far out of reach."
"494" "HAN" "Not for long..."
"495" "BEN" "A fighter that size couldn't go that deep into space alone."
"496" "LUKE" "So he must have gotten lost, part of a convoy or something..."
"497" "HAN" "Well, he's not going to stick around long enough to tell anyone about us."
"498" "LUKE" "Look at him. He's going to that little moon."
"499" "HAN" "I think I can catch him before he gets there... he's almost in range."
"500" "BEN" "That's not the moon! It's a space station."
"501" "HAN" "It's too big to be a space station."
"502" "LUKE" "I have a bad feeling about this."
"503" "BEN" "Turn the ship around!"
"504" "HAN" "Yeah, I think you're right. Complete reverse! Chewie, block the auxiliary power."
"505" "LUKE" "Why are we still moving towards this?"
"506" "HAN" "We're trapped in a tractor beam! It's pulling us!"
"507" "LUKE" "But there has to be something you can do!"
"508" "HAN" "There's nothing I can do about it, kid. I'm at full power. I'm going to have to pull the plug. But they won't take me without a fight!"
"509" "BEN" "You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting."
"510" "VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM" "Clear Bay twenty-three seven. We're opening the magnetic field."
"511" "OFFICIAL" "To your stations!"
"512" "OFFICER" "Come with me."
"513" "OFFICIAL" "Close all external wards! Close all external wards!"
"514" "TARKIN" "Yes."
"515" "VOICE" "We captured a freighter entering the ruins of the Alderaan system. Its markings match those of a ship leaving Mos Eisley."
"516" "VADER" "They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess. She may still be of some use to us."
"517" "VOICE" "Unlock one-five-seven-nine. Release the charges."
"518" "OFFICER" "There is no one on board, sir. According to the log, the crew abandoned ship shortly after takeoff. Must be a decoy, sir. Several escape pods were discarded."
"519" "VADER" "Did you find any droids?"
"520" "OFFICER" "No, sir. If there were any on board, they must have abandoned it as well."
"521" "VADER" "Send a scan team aboard. I want every part of this ship checked."
"522" "OFFICER" "Yes, sir."
"523" "VADER" "I feel something... a presence I haven't felt since..."
"524" "OFFICER" "Get me a double scan team here. I want every part of this ship checked!"
"525" "LUKE" "Boy, how lucky are you to have those compartments."
"526" "HAN" "I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get past the tractor beam."
"527" "BEN" "Leave it to me!"
"528" "HAN" "Damn idiot. I knew you were going to say that!"
"529" "BEN" "Who is more foolish... the fool or the fool who follows him?"
"530" "TROOPER" "The ship is all yours. If the scanners detect anything, report it immediately. Alright, let's go."
"531" "HAN" "Hey, could you give us a hand with this?"
"532" "GANTRY OFFICER" "TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post? TX-four-one-two, do you copy?"
"533" "GANTRY OFFICER" "Take over. We have a bad transmitter. I'll see what I can do."
"534" "LUKE" "You know, between his howling and you blowing up everything in sight, it's a wonder the entire station doesn't know we're here."
"535" "HAN" "Bring them in! I prefer a straight fight to all this confusion."
"536" "THREEPIO" "We found the computer socket, sir."
"537" "BEN" "Connect. It should be able to interpret the entire Imperial computer network."
"538" "THREEPIO" "He says he has found the main control of the energy beam that is holding the ship here. He will try to get the precise location to appear on the monitor."
"539" "THREEPIO" "The tractor beam attaches to the main reactor in seven locations. A loss of power at one of the terminals will allow the ship to leave."
"540" "BEN" "I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone."
"541" "HAN" "Whatever you say. I've done more than I expected on this trip."
"542" "LUKE" "I want to go with you."
"543" "BEN" "Be patient, Luke. Stay and take care of the droids."
"544" "LUKE" "But he can..."
"545" "BEN" "They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny is on a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always!"
"546" "HAN" "Man, you said it, Chewie."
"547" "HAN" "Where did you dig up that old fossil?"
"548" "LUKE" "Ben is a great man."
"549" "HAN" "Yeah, great for getting us in trouble."
"550" "LUKE" "I didn't hear you give any ideas..."
"551" "HAN" "Well, anything would be better than waiting for them to pick us up..."
"552" "LUKE" "Who do you think..."
"553" "LUKE" "What is it?"
"554" "THREEPIO" "I guess I'm not sure, sir. He says \"I found her\" and keeps saying \"She's here\""
"555" "LUKE" "Well, who... who did he meet?"
"556" "THREEPIO" "Princess Leia."
"557" "LUKE" "The princess? Is she here?"
"558" "HAN" "Princess?"
"559" "LUKE" "Where...where is she?"
"560" "HAN" "Princess? What's going on?"
"561" "THREEPIO" "Level five. Detention block AA-twenty-three. I'm afraid she's scheduled for dismissal."
"562" "LUKE" "Oh no! We have to do something."
"563" "HAN" "What are you talking about?"
"564" "LUKE" "The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message. We have to help her."
"565" "HAN" "Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to wait right here."
"566" "LUKE" "But he didn't know she was here. Look, are you going to find a way back to the detention block?"
"567" "HAN" "I'm not going anywhere."
"568" "LUKE" "They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay."
"569" "HAN" "Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind."
"570" "LUKE" "But they're going to kill her!"
"571" "HAN" "Better her than me..."
"572" "LUKE" "She's rich."
"573" "HAN" "Rich?"
"574" "LUKE" "Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be..."
"575" "HAN" "What?"
"576" "LUKE" "Well, more wealth than you can imagine."
"577" "HAN" "I don't know, I can imagine a lot!"
"578" "LUKE" "You'll do it!"
"579" "HAN" "I better!"
"580" "LUKE" "Will you..."
"581" "HAN" "Alright, kid. But you better be right about this!"
"582" "LUKE" "Okay."
"583" "HAN" "What's your plan?"
"584" "LUKE" "Uh... Threepio, give me those binders, will you?"
"585" "LUKE" "Okay. Now, I'm going to put this on you."
"586" "LUKE" "Okay. Han, you put it on."
"587" "HAN" "Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind."
"588" "THREEPIO" "Master Luke, sir! Forgive me for asking... but, ah... what should Artoo and I do if we are discovered here?"
"589" "LUKE" "Lock the door!"
"590" "HAN" "And I hope they don't have blasters."
"591" "THREEPIO" "That's not very comforting."
"592" "LUKE" "I can't see anything in this helmet."
"593" "HAN" "That won't work."
"594" "LUKE" "Why didn't you say that before?"
"595" "HAN" "I said that before!"
"596" "OFFICER" "Where are you taking this... thing?"
"597" "LUKE" "Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight."
"598" "OFFICIAL" "I haven't been notified. I'll have to clean it up."
"599" "HAN" "Careful! He's loose!"
"600" "LUKE" "He's going to tear us apart."
"601" "HAN" "Go get him!"
"602" "HAN" "We have to find out which cell this princess of yours is in. Here she is... cell twenty-one and eight and seven. You go get her. I'll keep them here."
"603" "HAN" "Everything is under control. Situation is normal."
"604" "VOICE INTERCOM" "What happened?"
"605" "HAN" "Uh... there was a little malfunction in the weapons. But, uh, everything is perfectly fine now. We're fine. We're all fine here, now, thank you. How are you?"
"606" "INTERCOM VOICE" "We're sending a squad."
"607" "HAN" "Uh, uh, negative, negative. We've got a leak in the reactor here now. Give us a few minutes to block it. Big leak... very dangerous."
"608" "INTERCOM VOICE" "Who is this? What is your operation number?"
"609" "HAN" "Boring talk anyway. Luke! We'll have company!"
"610" "READ" "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?"
"611" "LUKE" "What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you."
"612" "READ" "Who are you?"
"613" "LUKE" "I'm here to rescue you. I have your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi."
"614" "READ" "Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?"
"615" "LUKE" "Let's go!"
"616" "VADER" "He's here..."
"617" "TARKIN" "Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think that?"
"618" "VADER" "A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my former master."
"619" "TARKIN" "Surely he must be dead now."
"620" "VADER" "Don't underestimate the Force."
"621" "TARKIN" "The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe. You, my friend, are all that remains of their religion."
"622" "TARKIN" "Yes."
"623" "INTERCOM VOICE" "Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in detention block AA-twenty-three."
"624" "TARKIN" "The princess! Put all sections on alert!"
"625" "VADER" "Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him."
"626" "TARKIN" "If you're right, he can't escape."
"627" "VADER" "Escape may not be your plan. I must face it alone."
"628" "HAN" "Chewie!"
"629" "HAN" "Stay behind me! Stay behind me!"
"630" "HAN" "You can't leave like that."
"631" "READ" "Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route."
"632" "HAN" "Perhaps you would like back in your cell, Your Highness."
"633" "LUKE" "See-Three! See-Three!"
"634" "THREE" "Yes sir?"
"635" "LUKE" "We were cut! Are there other ways to get out of the cell?...What was that? I didn't copy!"
"636" "THREEPIO" "I told you, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance appears to be the only exit; all other information on your level is restricted."
"637" "SOLDIER'S VOICE" "Open up!"
"638" "THREEPIO" "Oh no!"
"639" "LUKE" "There is no other way."
"640" "HAN" "I can't hold them forever! What now?"
"641" "READ" "This is a rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a plan to get out?"
"642" "HAN" "He's the brains, honey."
"643" "LUKE" "Well, I don't..."
"644" "HAN" "What the hell are you doing?"
"645" "READ" "Someone has to save our skins. In the trash, smart guy."
"646" "HAN" "Get in there you big hairy idiot! I don't care what you smell like! Get in there and don't worry about it."
"647" "HAN" "Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm starting to like her. Get in there!"
"648" "HAN" "Ah! The trash chute was a really wonderful idea. What an incredible smell you discovered! Let's get out of here! Get out of there..."
"649" "LUKE" "No! Wait!"
"650" "LUKE" "Are you going to forget? I already tried. It's magnetically sealed!"
"651" "READ" "Put that thing away! You're going to kill us all."
"652" "HAN" "Absolutely, Your Honor. Look, I had everything under control until you brought us here. You know, it won't take long for them to figure out what happened to us."
"653" "READ" "It could be worse..."
"654" "HAN" "It's worse."
"655" "LUKE" "There's something alive here!"
"656" "HAN" "That's your imagination."
"657" "LUKE" "Something goes through my leg! Look! Did you see that?"
"658" "HAN" "What?"
"659" "LUKE" "Help!"
"660" "HAN" "Luke! Luke! Luke!"
"661" "READ" "Luke!"
"662" "READ" "Luke, Luke, take this."
"663" "LUKE" "Dammit, please! My gun is jammed."
"664" "HAN" "Where?"
"665" "LUKE" "Anywhere! Oh!!"
"666" "HAN" "Luke! Luke!"
"667" "READ" "Grab him!"
"668" "READ" "What happened?"
"669" "LUKE" "I don't know, he just let me go and disappeared..."
"670" "HAN" "I have a bad feeling about this."
"671" "LUKE" "The walls are moving!"
"672" "READ" "Don't just stand there. Try to hold him with something."
"673" "LUKE" "Wait a minute!"
"674" "LUKE" "Threepio! Come on Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?"
"675" "FIRST SOLDIER" "Take over! Take care of him! Look over there!"
"676" "THREEPIO" "They're crazy! They're heading for the prison level. If you hurry, you can catch them."
"677" "FIRST OFFICER" "Follow me! You stand guard."
"678" "THREEPIO" "Come on!"
"679" "THREEPIO" "Ah! All this excitement has invaded my colleague's circuits here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him in for maintenance."
"680" "SOLDIER" "Okay."
"681" "LUKE" "Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!"
"682" "HAN" "Get to the top!"
"683" "READ" "I can't"
"684" "LUKE" "Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, can you come in?"
"685" "THREEPIO" "They're not here! Something must have happened to them. See if they've been captured."
"686" "THREEPIO" "Quick!"
"687" "HAN" "One thing is for sure. We're all going to get a lot thinner! Stay on top of it!"
"688" "READ" "I'm trying!"
"689" "THREEPIO" "Thank God, they didn't find them! Where could they be?"
"690" "THREEPIO" "Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!"
"691" "THREEPIO" "Are you there, sir?"
"692" "LUKE" "Threepies!"
"693" "THREEPIO" "We had some problems..."
"694" "LUKE" "Close all garbage disposals on the detention level, will you? Will you copy?"
"695" "LUKE" "Close all garbage disposals on the detention level."
"696" "LUKE" "Close all garbage disposals on the detention level."
"697" "THREEPIO" "No. Turn them all off! Hurry!"
"698" "THREEPIO" "Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Damn my metal body! I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!"
"699" "LUKE" "Threepio, we're fine!"
"700" "LUKE" "We're fine. You did great."
"701" "LUKE" "Hey... hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number... where are we?"
"702" "HAN" "Three-two-six-eight-two-seven."
"703" "HAN" "If we can avoid any more female advice, we should be able to get out of here."
"704" "LUKE" "Well, let's get moving!"
"705" "HAN" "Where are you going?"
"706" "READ" "No, wait. They will hear!"
"707" "HAN" "Come here, you big coward!"
"708" "HAN" "Chewie! Come here!"
"709" "READ" "Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you do as I say. Okay?"
"710" "HAN" "Look, Your Excellency, let's get something straight! I take orders from one person! Me!"
"711" "READ" "It's a wonder you're still alive. Will someone get this big walking carpet out of my way?"
"712" "HAN" "No reward is worth this."
"713" "OFFICIAL" "Secure this area until the alert is canceled."
"714" "FIRST SOLDIER" "Give me regular reports."
"715" "FIRST SOLDIER" "Do you know what's going on?"
"716" "SECOND SOLDIER" "Maybe it's another exercise."
"717" "SECOND SOLDIER" "What was that?"
"718" "FIRST SOLDIER" "Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."
"719" "HAN" "There she is."
"720" "LUKE" "See-Threepio, do you copy?"
"721" "THREEPIO" "Right now. Uh, we're in the main hangar in front of the ship."
"722" "LUKE" "We're right above you. Hold on."
"723" "READ" "You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought."
"724" "HAN" "Cool! Let's go!"
"725" "FIRST SOLDIER" "It's them! Destroy them!"

"727" "LUKE" "Where are you going? Come back!"
"728" "READ" "He certainly has courage."
"729" "LUKE" "What good will it do us if he kills himself? Let's go!"
"730" "LUKE" "I think we took a wrong turn."
"731" "READ" "There is no lock!"
"732" "LUKE" "That should hold for a while."

"739" "THREEPIO" "Where could they be?"
"740" "TROOPER" "Close the security doors!"
"741" "TROOPER" "Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!"
"742" "VADER" "I have been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete."
"743" "VADER" "When I left you, I was just the apprentice; now I am the master."
"744" "BEN" "Just a master of evil, Darth."
"745" "VADER" "Your powers are weak, old man."
"746" "BEN" "You can't win, Darth. If you take me down, I will become more powerful than you can imagine."
"747" "HAN" "Didn't we just leave this party?"
"748" "HAN" "What held you?"
"749" "READ" "We ran into some old friends."
"750" "LUKE" "Is the ship okay?"
"751" "HAN" "Sounds good, if we can get it. I just hope the old man took the tractor beam out of service."
"752" "LUKE" "Look!"
"753" "THREEPIO" "Come on, Artoo, we're coming!"
"754" "HAN" "Now's our chance! Go!"
"755" "LUKE" "No!"
"756" "HAN" "Let's go!"
"757" "READ" "Come on! Luke, it's too late!"
"758" "HAN" "Fix the door! Kid!"
"759" "BEN" "Run, Luke! Run!"
"760" "HAN" "I hope the old man took out that tractor beam if it's working, or this is going to be a pretty short trip. Okay, get it right!"
"761" "HAN" "We're approaching the sentry ships. Hold them off! Tilt the deflector shields while I load the main cannons!"
"762" "LUKE" "I can't believe he's gone."
"763" "READ" "There was nothing you could have done."
"764" "HAN" "Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!"
"765" "HAN" "You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!"
"766" "READ" "Here they come!"
"767" "LUKE" "They're coming too fast!"
"768" "THREEPIO" "Oooh!"
"769" "READ" "We've lost the side controls."
"770" "HAN" "Don't worry, she'll handle it."
"771" "HAN" "Did you hear me, baby? Hang in there!"
"772" "LUKE" "I got him! I got him!"
"773" "HAN" "Great kid! Don't be arrogant."
"774" "READ" "There are still two more out there!"
"775" "LUKE" "That's it! We did it!"
"776" "READ" "We did it!"
"777" "THREEPIO" "Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault."
"778" "TARKIN" "Are they out?"
"779" "VADER" "They just jumped into hyperspace."
"780" "TARKIN" "Are you sure the tracking beacon is safe aboard their ship? I'm taking a terrible risk, Vader. This better work."
"781" "HAN" "Not a bad rescue, huh? You know, sometimes I even surprise myself."
"782" "READ" "That doesn't seem too difficult. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape."
"783" "HAN" "Easy... you call that easy?"
"784" "READ" "They're tracking us!"
"785" "HAN" "Not this ship, sister."
"786" "READ" "At least the information on Artoo is still intact."
"787" "HAN" "What's so important? What is he carrying?"
"788" "READ" "The technical readings from that battle station. I can only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!"
"789" "HAN" "It's for me, sister! Look, I'm not in it for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, princess. I hope I get paid well. I'm in it for the money!"
"790" "READ" "You don't need to worry about your reward. If money is all you love, then that's what you'll get!"
"791" "READ" "Your friend is a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares about anything...or anyone."
"792" "LUKE" "I care!"
"793" "LUKE" "So... what do you think of her, Han?"
"794" "HAN" "I'm trying not to, kid!"
"795" "LUKE" "Good..."
"796" "HAN" "Still, she has a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me..."
"797" "LUKE" "No!"
"798" "WILLARD" "You are safe! We had feared the worst."
"799" "WILLARD" "When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were... lost along with your father."
"800" "READ" "We have no time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle station has certainly located us here. It is the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the information from this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope."
"801" "TARKIN" "Yes."
"802" "DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE" "We are approaching the planet Yavin. The rebel base is on a moon on the other side. We are preparing to orbit the planet."
"803" "DODONNA" "The battle station is heavily armored and carries firepower greater than half that of Starfleet. Its defenses are designed around a large-scale direct attack. A small one-man fighter should be able to penetrate external defense."
"804" "GOLDEN LEADER" "Forgive me for asking, sir, but what good will snobbish fighters be against this?"
"805" "DODONNA" "Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to be a threat, or they would have a tighter defense. An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia demonstrated a weakness in the battle station."
"806" "DODONNA" "The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight through this trench and skim the surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It is a small thermal exhaust port, so below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction that should destroy the station.
"807" "DODONNA" "Just one precise hit will trigger a chain reaction. The shaft is shielded against lightning, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes."
"808" "WEDGE" "That's impossible, even for a computer."
"809" "LUKE" "It's not impossible. I used to hunt rats in my T-16 at home. They're not much bigger than two meters."
"810" "DODONNA" "Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!"
"811" "DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE" "Orbiting the planet at maximum speed. The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes."
"812" "VADER" "This will be a day long remembered. He saw the end of Kenobi and will soon see the end of the Rebellion."
"813" "MAN" "All flight troops, man your stations. All flight troops, man your stations."
"814" "LUKE" "So... you've received your reward and are leaving?"
"815" "HAN" "That's right, yes! I have some old debts that I have to pay off with these things. Even if I didn't, don't you think I'd be foolish enough to stick around, do you? Why would you Won't you come with us? You're really good in a fight. I could use you."
"816" "LUKE" "Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them. "
"817" "HAN" "What good is a reward if you're not around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station isn't my idea of ​​courage. It's more like suicide."
"818" "LUKE" "Alright. Well, take care of yourself, Han... I guess that's what you're best at, isn't it?"
"819" "HAN" "Hey, Luke... may the Force be with you!"
"820" "HAN" "What are you looking at? I know what I'm doing."
"821" "READ" "What's wrong?"
"822" "LUKE" "Ah, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he would change his mind."
"823" "READ" "He has to follow his own path. No one can choose for him."
"824" "LUKE" "I just wish Ben was here."
"825" "BIGGS" "Luke! I can't believe it! How did you get here... are you going out with us?!"
"826" "LUKE" "Biggs! Of course, I'll be there with you! Listen, I have some stories to tell..."
"827" "RED LEADER" "Are you...Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked into the Incom T-65?"
"828" "BIGGS" "Sir, Luke is the best pilot in the outer rim territories."
"829" "RED LEADER" "I met your father once when I was just a boy. He was a great pilot. You will do well. If you have half as much skill as your father, you will do better than fine."
"830" "LUKE" "Thank you, sir. I'll try."
"831" "BIGGS" "I have to get on board. Listen, you're going to tell me your stories when we get back. Is that okay?"
"832" "LUKE" "I told you I'd make it one day, Biggs."
"833" "BIGGS" "You did it, okay. It'll be just like old times Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars who will never be stopped!"
"834" "BOSS" "This R2 unit of yours looks a little worn out. Do you want a new one?"
"835" "LUKE" "Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. Are you okay, Artoo?"
"836" "BOSS" "Okay, she takes it easy!"
"837" "THREEPIO" "Hang in there, Artoo, you have to go back."
"838" "THREEPIO" "You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?"
"839" "BEN" "Luke, the Force will be with you."
"840" "MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE" "Readiness alert. Death Star approaching. Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes."

"851" "RED LEADER" "We're passing through their magnetic field."
"852" "RED LEADER" "Hold on tight!"
"853" "RED LEADER" "Turn on your deflectors."
"854" "RED LEADER" "Double Front!"
"855" "CUNHA" "Look at the size of this thing!"
"856" "RED LEADER" "Cut the conversation, Red Two."
"857" "RED LEADER" "Accelerate to attack speed. That's it, boys!"
"858" "GOLD LEADER" "Red Leader, this is the Gold Leader."
"859" "RED LEADER" "I copy, Gold Leader."
"860" "GOLD LEADER" "We are starting now for the target well."
"861" "RED LEADER" "We're in position. I'll cut the shaft and try to draw their fire."
"862" "WEDGE" "Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-three degrees."
"863" "RED LEADER" "I understand. Stay down."
"864" "LUKE" "This is Red Five! I'm going in!"
"865" "BIGGS" "Luke, come up!"
"866" "BIGGS" "Are you okay?"
"867" "LUKE" "I got a little cooked, but I'm fine."
"868" "ASTRO-OFFICIAL" "We counted thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they are so small they are evading our turbo-lasers!"
"869" "VADER" "We'll have to destroy them ship by ship. Take the crews to your fighters."
"870" "RED LEADER" "Luke, let me know when you're going in."
"871" "LUKE" "I'm on my way..."
"872" "RED LEADER" "Careful! There's a lot of fire coming from the right side of that deflection tower."
"873" "LUKE" "I'm on it."
"874" "CONTROL OFFICER" "Squad leaders, we have picked up a new group of signals. Enemy combatants heading your way."
"875" "LUKE" "My aim is negative. I don't see anything."
"876" "RED LEADER" "Keep up your visual scan. With all this interference, they'll be on you before your scope can pick them up."
"877" "RED LEADER" "Biggs! You caught a...careful!"
"878" "BIGGS" "I can't see! Where is he?!"
"879" "BIGGS" "He's on top of me tight, I can't shake him... I can't shake him."
"880" "LUKE" "Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in."
"881" "LUKE" "I got him!"
"882" "VADER" "Several fighters have separated from the main group. Come with me!"
"883" "BIGGS" "Pull! Luke...pull!"
"884" "WEDGE" "Careful, Luke!"
"885" "WEDGE" "Watch your back! The fighter is above you, coming!"
"886" "LUKE" "I got hit, but not bad."
"887" "LUKE" "Artoo, see what you can do with this. Wait back there."
"888" "RED LEADER" "Red Six..."
"889" "RED LEADER" "Can you see Red Five?"
"890" "RED TEN" "There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red Five, where are you?"
"891" "LUKE" "I can't shake him!"
"892" "WEDGE" "I'm with him, Luke!"
"893" "CUNHA" "Wait!"
"894" "LUKE" "Damn! Shut up where are you?"
"895" "LUKE" "Thanks, Wedge."
"896" "BIGGS" "Good shot, Wedge!"
"897" "GOLD LEADER" "Red Leader..."
"898" "GOLD LEADER" "...This is Gold Leader. We are beginning the attack run."
"899" "RED LEADER" "I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position."
"900" "VADER" "Stay in attack formation!"
"901" "GOLD LEADER" "The exhaust post is..."
"902" "GOLD LEADER" "...marked and blocked!"
"903" "GOLD LEADER" "Switch power to front deflection screens."
"904" "GOLD LEADER" "How many weapons do you think, Gold Five?"
"905" "GOLD FIVE" "I'd say about twenty weapons. Some on the surface, some in the turrets."
"906" "MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE" "The Death Star will be in range in five minutes."
"907" "GOLD LEADER" "Switch to targeting computer."
"908" "GOLD TWO" "Computer is locked. Obtaining a signal."
"909" "GOLD TWO" "The guns... they stopped!"
"910" "GOLD FIVE" "Stabilize your rear deflectors. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters."
"911" "GOLD LEADER" "They're coming! Three marks at ten past two."
"912" "VADER" "I'll take them myself! Cover me!"
"913" "WINGMAN" "Yes, sir."
"914" "GOLDEN LEADER" "I can't maneuver!"
"915" "GOLDEN FIVE" "Stay on target."
"916" "GOLDEN LEADER" "We are very close."
"917" "GOLDEN FIVE" "Stay on target!"
"918" "GOLDEN LEADER" "Loosen!"
"919" "GOLDEN FIVE" "Golden Five for Red Leader..."
"920" "GOLD FIVE" "Lost Tiree, lost Dutch."
"921" "RED LEADER" "I copy, Gold Five."
"922" "GOLD FIVE" "They came from behind..."
"923" "OFFICER" "We have analyzed their attack, sir, and there is a danger. Should I have your ship on standby?"
"924" "TARKIN" "Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!"
"925" "VOICE" "Rebel base, three minutes and closing."
"926" "RED LEADER" "Red Group, this is the Red Leader."
"927" "RED LEADER" "Meet at mark six point one."
"928" "WEDGE" "This is Red Two. Flying towards you."
"929" "BIGGS" "Three Reds, standing by."
"930" "DODONNA" "Red Leader, this is Base One. Keep half of your group out of range for the next run."
"931" "RED LEADER" "Copy, Base One. Luke, take Red Two and Three. Stay here and wait for my signal... to begin your run."
"932" "RED LEADER" "That's it!"
"933" "RED TEN" "We should be able to see him now."
"934" "RED LEADER" "Keep your eyes peeled for these fighters!"
"935" "RED TEN" "There's too much interference!"
"936" "RED TEN" "Red Five, can you see them from where you are?"
"937" "LUKE" "No sign of any... wait!"
"938" "LUKE" "Arriving at point three and five."
"939" "RED TEN" "I see them."
"940" "RED LEADER" "I'm in range."
"941" "RED LEADER" "The target is approaching!"
"942" "RED LEADER" "Just hold them for a few seconds."
"943" "VADER" "Close formation."
"944" "RED LEADER" "Almost there!"
"945" "RED TEN" "You'd better let her go."
"946" "RED LEADER" "Almost there!"
"947" "RED TEN" "I can't hold them!"
"948" "RED LEADER" "You're out!"
"949" "RED NINE" "It's a success!"
"950" "RED LEADER" "Negative."
"951" "RED LEADER" "Negative! Didn't go in, just hit the surface."
"952" "LUKE" "Red Leader, we are right above you. Turn to aim..."
"953" "LUKE" "...oh-five; we've got you covered."
"954" "RED LEADER" "Stay there..."
"955" "RED LEADER" "...I just lost my starboard engine."
"956" "RED LEADER" "Prepare for your attack run."
"957" "DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE" "Rebel base, one minute and closing."
"958" "LUKE" "Biggs, Wedge, let's close. Let's go in. Let's go full steam ahead."
"959" "WEDGE" "Right with you, boss."
"960" "BIGGS" "Luke, at this speed will you be able to get out in time?"
"961" "LUKE" "It'll be just like Beggar's Canyon back home."
"962" "BIGGS" "We'll stay far enough away to cover you."
"963" "WEDGE" "My scope shows the turret, but I can't see the exhaust outlet! Are you sure the computer can hit it?"
"964" "LUKE" "Careful! Increase speed to full throttle!"
"965" "CUNHA" "And that tower?"
"966" "LUKE" "You care about those fighters! I care about the tower!"
"967" "LUKE" "Artoo... yeah, that stabilizer is loose again! See if you can't lock it!"
"968" "WEDGE" "I've been hit! I can't be with you."
"969" "LUKE" "Back off, Wedge."
"970" "LUKE" "You can't do any more good back there!"
"971" "CUNHA" "Sorry!"
"972" "VADER" "Let him go! Stay leader!"
"973" "BIGGS" "Hurry up, Luke, they're coming much faster this time. I can't hold them back!"
"974" "LUKE" "Artoo, try to increase the power!"
"975" "BIGGS" "Hurry up, Luke!"
"976" "BIGGS" "Wait!"
"977" "DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE" "Rebel base, thirty seconds and closing."
"978" "VADER" "I'm on the leader."
"979" "THREEPIO" "Hang on, Artoo!"
"980" "BEN" "Use the Force, Luke."
"981" "BEN" "Let go, Luke."
"982" "VADER" "The Force is strong with this one!"
"983" "BEN" "Luke, trust me."
"984" "BASE VOICE" "His computer is off. Luke, you turned off the targeting computer. What's wrong?"
"985" "LUKE" "Nothing. I'm fine."
"986" "LUKE" "I lost Artoo!"
"987" "MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE" "The Death Star wiped the planet. The Death Star wiped the planet."
"988" "DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE" "Rebel base, in range."
"989" "TARKIN" "You can fire when you're ready."
"990" "DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE" "Start primary ignition."
"991" "VADER" "I have you now."
"992" "VADER" "What?"
"993" "HAN" "Yahoo!"
"994" "WINGMAN" "Watch out!"
"995" "HAN" "You're okay, kid."
"996" "HAN" "Now let's blow this thing up and go home!"
"997" "INTERCOM VOICE" "Stand by to fire on the Rebel base."
"998" "VOICE INTERCOM" "Waiting."
"999" "HAN" "Great photo, kid. That was one in a million."
"1000" "BEN" "Remember, the Force will be with you...always."
"1001" "READ" "Luke! Luke! Luke!"
"1002" "HAN" "Hey! Hey!"
"1003" "LUKE" "I knew you'd come back! I knew it!"
"1004" "HAN" "Well, I wasn't going to let you take all the credit and keep all the reward."
"1005" "READ" "Hey, I knew you were more than money."
"1006" "LUKE" "Oh no!"
"1007" "THREEPIO" "Oh, my God! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! You can fix it, can't you?"
"1008" "TECHNICIAN" "Let's work on it immediately."
"1009" "THREEPIO" "You must fix it! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears help, I will gladly donate them."
"1010" "LUKE" "He's going to be okay."
