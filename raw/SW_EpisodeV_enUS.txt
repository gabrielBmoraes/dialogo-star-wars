"1" "LUKE" "Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old friend, do you read me?"
"2" "HAN" "Loud and clear, kid. What's up?"
"3" "LUKE" "Well, I've finished my circle. I don't get any life reading."
"4" "HAN" "There isn't enough life in this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. The sensors are in place. I'm going back."
"5" "LUKE" "Okay. I'll see you soon. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long."
"6" "LUKE" "Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? Do you smell something?"
"7" "LUKE" "Aaargh!"
"8" "HAN" "Chewie!"
"9" "HAN" "Okay, don't lose your cool. I'll be right back and give you a hand."
"10" "RIEEKAN" "Alone?"
"11" "HAN" "No signs of life out there, General. The sensors are in place. You'll know if something happens."
"12" "RIEEKAN" "Has Commander Skywalker arrived yet?"
"13" "HAN" "No. He's checking out a meteorite that fell near him."
"14" "RIEEKAN" "With all the meteor activity in this system, it will be difficult to detect approaching ships."
"15" "HAN" "General, I have to leave. I can't stay any longer."
"16" "RIEEKAN" "I'm sorry to hear that."
"17" "HAN" "Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay Jabba the Hut, I'm a dead man."
"18" "RIEEKAN" "A death mark is not an easy thing to live with. You're a good fighter, Solo. I hate losing you."
"19" "HAN" "Thank you, General."
"20" "HAN" "Well, Your Highness, I guess that's it."
"21" "READ" "That's right."
"22" "HAN" "Well, don't get all soft on me. See you later, Princess."
"23" "READ" "Han!"
"24" "HAN" "Yes, Your Highness?"
"25" "READ" "I thought you decided to stay."
"26" "HAN" "Well, the bounty hunter we met on Ord Mantell changed my mind."
"27" "READ" "Han, we need you!"
"28" "HAN" "We?"
"29" "READ" "Yes."
"30" "HAN" "Oh, what do you need?"
"31" "READ" "Do I need to? I don't know what you're talking about."
"32" "HAN" "You probably don't."
"33" "READ" "And what exactly should I know?"
"34" "HAN" "Come on! You want me to stay because of how you feel about me."
"35" "READ" "Yes. You are a great help to us. You are a natural leader..."
"36" "HAN" "No! It's not that. Let's go. Aahhh -- uh huh! Let's go."
"37" "READ" "You're imagining things."
"38" "HAN" "I am? Then why are you following me? Afraid I'll leave without kissing you goodbye?"
"39" "READ" "I'd rather kiss a Wookiee."
"40" "HAN" "I can arrange that. You need a good kiss!"
"41" "THREEPIO" "Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I just commented that it was freezing in the princess's room. But it should have been freezing. How are we going to dry all her clothes? I really don't know."
"42" "THREEPIO" "Ah, hang up."
"43" "HAN" "Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us out of here and you pull them both."
"44" "THREEPIO" "Excuse me, sir."
"45" "HAN" "Put them back together right now."
"46" "THREEPIO" "Can I have a word with you, please?"
"47" "HAN" "What do you want?"
"48" "THREEPIO" "Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's trying to get you on the communicator."
"49" "HAN" "I hung up. I don't want to talk to her."
"50" "THREEPIO" "Ah. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't returned yet. She doesn't know where he is."
"51" "HAN" "I don't know where he is."
"52" "THREEPIO" "Nobody knows where he is."
"53" "HAN" "What do you mean \"nobody knows\"?"
"54" "THREEPIO" "Well, uh, you see..."
"55" "HAN" "Deck Officer. Deck Officer!"
"56" "THREEPIO" "Excuse me, sir. May I inqu-..."
"57" "DECK OFFICER" "Yes, sir?"
"58" "HAN" "Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?"
"59" "DECK OFFICER" "I didn't see him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance."
"60" "HAN" "Is it possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark outside."
"61" "DECK OFFICER" "Yes, sir."
"62" "THREEPIO" "Excuse me, sir. May I ask what's going on?"
"63" "HAN" "Why not?"
"64" "THREEPIO" "Impossible man. Come, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between you and me, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger."
"65" "DECK OFFICER" "Sir, Commander Skywalker did not enter through the south entrance. He may have forgotten to check in."
"66" "HAN" "Not likely. Are the speeders ready?"
"67" "DECK OFFICER" "Not yet. We're having trouble adapting them to the cold."
"68" "HAN" "Then we'll have to leave in Tauntauns."
"69" "DECK OFFICER" "Sir, the temperature is dropping very quickly."
"70" "HAN" "That's right. And my friends outside."
"71" "ASSISTANT OFFICER" "I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set alpha screen."
"72" "DECK OFFICER" "Your Tauntaun will freeze before you reach the first marker."
"73" "HAN" "Then I'll see you in hell!"
"74" "THREEPIO" "You must come now, Artoo. There's really nothing else we can do. And my joints are freezing."
"75" "THREEPIO" "Don't say things like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be fine, you'll see. Stupid short circuit. He'll be fine. right."
"76" "LIEUTENANT" "Sir, all patrols are in. No contact yet from Skywalker or Solo."
"77" "THREEPIO" "Lady Leia, Artoo says he has been unable to pick up any signal, though he admits his own range is too weak to abandon all hope."
"78" "DERLIN" "Your Highness, there is nothing more we can do tonight. The armored doors must be closed."
"79" "DERLIN" "Close the doors."
"80" "LIEUTENANT" "Yes, sir."
"81" "THREEPIO" "Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred and seventy-five... to one."
"82" "THREEPIO" "Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be fine. . He It's quite intelligent, you know... for a human being."
"83" "BEN" "Luke...Luke."
"84" "LUKE" "Ben?"
"85" "BEN" "You will go to the Dagobah system."
"86" "LUKE" "Dagobah System?"
"87" "BEN" "There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me."
"88" "LUKE" "Ben...Ben."
"89" "HAN" "Luke! Luke! Don't do that, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here."
"90" "HAN" "Not long."
"91" "LUKE" "Ben...Ben..."
"92" "HAN" "Hang on, kid."
"93" "LUKE" "Dagobah System..."
"94" "HAN" "Phew..."
"95" "LUKE" "Dagobah..."
"96" "HAN" "That might smell bad, kid..."
"97" "LUKE" "Yoda..."
"98" "HAN" "...but it will keep you warm...until I build the shelter. Ooh...I thought they smelled bad outside!"
"99" "ZEV" "Echo Base... I have something! Not much, but it could be a life form."
"100" "ZEV" "This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, you copy? This is Rouge Two."
"101" "HAN" "Good morning. I'm glad you came."
"102" "ZEV" "Echo Base... this is Rouge Two. I found them. I repeat, I found them."
"103" "THREEPIO" "Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional again."
"104" "THREEPIO" "Artoo expresses his relief as well."
"105" "HAN" "How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact, you look strong enough to rip a Gundark's ears off."
"106" "LUKE" "Thanks to you."
"107" "HAN" "That's two you owe me, junior."
"108" "HAN" "Well, Your Honor, it looks like you managed to keep me around for a while longer."
"109" "READ" "I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it is dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we have activated the energy shield."
"110" "HAN" "That's a good story. I guess you just can't let a hot guy like me out of your sight."
"111" "READ" "I don't know where you get your delusions from, laser brain."
"112" "HAN" "Laugh at that, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage."
"113" "HAN" "She expressed her true feelings for me."
"114" "READ" "My...! Why, you stuck-up,... stupid,... scruffy-looking... nerf-herder!"
"115" "HAN" "Who's scruffy looking? I must have hit her pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?"
"116" "READ" "Now, I guess you still don't know everything about women?"
"117" "ANNOUNCER" "Headquarters personnel, report to the command center."
"118" "HAN" "Calm down."
"119" "THREEPIO" "Excuse me, please."
"120" "RIEEKAN" "Princess... we have a visitor."
"121" "RIEEKAN" "We picked up something outside the base in zone twelve, moving east."
"122" "SENIOR CONTROLLER" "It's metal."
"123" "READ" "Then it can't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke."
"124" "HAN" "It could be a speeder, one of ours."
"125" "SENIOR CONTROLLER" "No. Hold on - there's something very faint coming."
"126" "THREEPIO" "Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code."
"127" "HAN" "It's not friendly, whatever. Come on, Chewie, let's take a look."
"128" "RIEEKAN" "Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three and eight."
"129" "HAN" "I'm afraid there isn't much left."
"130" "READ" "What happened?"
"131" "HAN" "Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have self-destructed."
"132" "LEIA" "An Imperial probe droid."
"133" "HAN" "It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here."
"134" "RIEEKAN" "We'd better start the evacuation."
"135" "PIETT" "Admiral."
"136" "OZZEL" "Yes, Captain"
"137" "PIETT" "I think we have something, sir. The report is just a fragment."
"138" "OZZEL" "We have thousands of probe droids scouring the galaxy. I want proof, not clues!"
"139" "PIETT" "The visuals indicate readings of life."
"140" "OZZEL" "It could mean anything. If we follow all the clues..."
"141" "PIETT" "But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms."
"142" "VADER" "Did you find anything?"
"143" "PIETT" "Yes, my lord."
"144" "VADER" "That's it. The rebels are there."
"145" "OZZEL" "My lord, there are so many unknown settlements. They could be smugglers, they could be..."
"146" "VADER" "That's the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men."
"147" "REBEL CAPTAIN" "Groups seven and ten will remain behind to fly the speeders. Once each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give the go-ahead for immediate launch."
"148" "REBEL FIGHTER" "Okay, sir."
"149" "HAN" "Okay, that's it. Try it... Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off!"
"150" "MEDICAL DROID" "Sir, it will take a while to evacuate the T-47s."
"151" "LUKE" "Well, forget about the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get the smaller modules onto the transports."
"152" "MEDICAL DROID" "Careful, sir."
"153" "LUKE" "Thank you."
"154" "LUKE" "Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?"
"155" "HAN" "Hey, kid. There must be a reason for this. Check the other end. Wait a second. Are you okay?"
"156" "LUKE" "Yes."
"157" "HAN" "Be careful."
"158" "LUKE" "You too."
"159" "CONTROLLER" "General, there is a fleet of Star Destroyers exiting hyperspace in sector four."
"160" "RIEEKAN" "Redirect all energy to the energy shield. We have to hold them until all transports move away. Prepare for ground attack."
"161" "VADER" "What is it, General?"
"162" "VEERS" "My lord, the fleet has moved out of light speed. Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment. "
"163" "VADER" "The Rebels have been alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel dropped from light speed very close to the system."
"164" "VEERS" "He thought surprise was wiser..."
"165" "VADER" "He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops for a surface attack."
"166" "VIAR" "Yes, my lord."
"167" "OZZEL" "Lord Vader, the fleet has left lightspeed, and we are preparing to... Aaagh!"
"168" "VADER" "You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett."
"169" "PIETT" "Yes, my lord."
"170" "VADER" "Prepare to land troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so nothing leaves this system. You are in command now, Admiral Piett."
"171" "PIETT" "Thank you, Lord Vader."
"172" "READ" "All troop carriers will gather at the north entrance. Heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they are loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short period of time, so you will have to stay very close to your transports."
"173" "HOBBIE" "Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?"
"174" "READ" "The ion cannon will fire several rounds to ensure that any enemy ships are out of its flight path. When you pass through the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point. Understood?"
"175" "PILOTS" "Right. Right."
"176" "READ" "Good luck."
"177" "DERLIN" "Okay. Everyone to their stations. Let's go!"
"178" "RIEEKAN" "Your main target will be the power generators. Prepare to open the shield."
"179" "CONTROLLER" "Sir, rebel ships are entering our sector."
"180" "CAPTAIN" "Good. Our first catch of the day."
"181" "WOMAN CONTROLLER" "Hold on, ion control....Fire!"
"182" "ANNOUNCER" "The first transport is far away."
"183" "DACK" "Feeling okay, sir?"
"184" "LUKE" "Like new, Dack. What about you?"
"185" "DACK" "Right now I feel like I could take on the entire Empire alone."
"186" "LUKE" "I know what you mean."
"187" "TRENCH OFFICER" "Three-T-Eight Echo Station."
"188" "TRENCH OFFICER" "We have spotted Imperial walkers!"
"189" "CONTROLLER" "Imperial Walkers on North Ridge."
"190" "LUKE" "Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way."
"191" "LUKE" "Alright boys, stand your ground now."
"192" "DACK" "Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not ready."
"193" "LUKE" "Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!"
"194" "LUKE" "Okay, I'm coming in."
"195" "LUKE" "Hobbie, are you still with me?"
"196" "LUKE" "That armor is too strong for blasters."
"197" "LUKE" "Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow lines. Go for the legs. It might be our only chance to stop them. Alright, hold on, Dack."
"198" "DACK" "Luke, we have a malfunction in the fire control. I'm going to have to cut the auxiliary."
"199" "LUKE" "Hang in there. Hang in there, Dack. Get ready to fire that towline."
"200" "LUKE" "Dack? Dack!"
"201" "VEERS" "Yes, Lord Vader. I have reached the main power generator. The shield will fall in moments. You can begin landing."
"202" "LUKE" "Rouge Three."
"203" "WEDGE" "Copy, Rouge Leader"
"204" "LUKE" "Wedge, I lost my gunner. You're going to have to make that shot. I'll cover you. Put up your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass."
"205" "CUNHA" "Approaching, Rouge Leader."
"206" "LUKE" "Steady, Rouge Two"
"207" "WEDGE" "Activate harpoon."
"208" "WEDGE" "Good shot, Janson."
"209" "CUNHA" "One more pass."
"210" "JANSON" "Approaching. Once again."
"211" "JANSON" "One more."
"212" "JANSON" "Fire out! Let her go!"
"213" "WEDGE" "Disconnect cable."
"214" "JANSON" "Cable disconnected."
"215" "TRENCH OFFICER" "Come on!"
"216" "WEDGE" "Whooha!! That got him!"
"217" "LUKE" "I understand, Wedge. Good work."
"218" "RIEEKAN" "I don't think we can protect two transports at the same time."
"219" "READ" "It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice."
"220" "RIEEKAN" "Launch patrols."
"221" "READ" "Evacuate remaining ground personnel."
"222" "HAN" "No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?"
"223" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And... take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear."
"224" "VEERS" "All troops will disembark for ground attack. Prepare to hit the main generator."
"225" "LUKE" "Rouge Two, are you okay?"
"226" "ZEV" "Yes. I'm with you, Leader Rouge."
"227" "LUKE" "Let's put the harpoon in. I'll cover you."
"228" "ZEV" "Coming this way."
"229" "LUKE" "Watch out for the crossfire, boys."
"230" "ZEV" "Set to position three. Steady."
"231" "LUKE" "Stay steady and down."
"232" "LUKE" "Hobbie, I got hit!"
"233" "HAN" "Are you okay?"
"234" "READ" "Why are you still here?"
"235" "HAN" "I heard the command center was hit."
"236" "READ" "You are allowed to leave."
"237" "HAN" "Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'll take you to your ship."
"238" "THREEPIO" "Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It is our only hope."
"239" "READ" "Send all troops from sector twelve to the southern slope to protect the fighters."
"240" "ANNOUNCER" "Imperial troops have entered the base."
"241" "HAN" "Come on...that's it."
"242" "READ" "Give the evacuation code signal. And get to your transports!"
"243" "PRINCIPAL CONTROLLER" "K-one-zero... all troops disengage."
"244" "THREEPIO" "Oh! Wait for me!"
"245" "OFFICER" "Begin retreat!"
"246" "SECOND OFFICER" "Back off!"
"247" "VIAR" "Distance to power generators?"
"248" "PILOT" "One-seven, decimal two-eight."
"249" "VIAR" "Target. Maximum firepower."
"250" "HAN" "Transportation, this is Solo. Better take off -- I can't get to you. I'll get the princess out in the Falcon."
"251" "THREEPIO" "But... but... but... where are you going? Uh... come back!!"
"252" "THREEPIO" "Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!"
"253" "THREEPIO" "How typical."
"254" "HAN" "Let's go."
"255" "HAN" "Hurry up, Goldenrod, or you'll be a permanent resident!"
"256" "THREEPIO" "Wait! Wait!"
"257" "HAN" "How is that?"
"258" "READ" "Would it help if I got out and pushed?"
"259" "HAN" "You can."
"260" "THREEPIO" "Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, may I suggest that you..."
"261" "THREEPIO" "It can wait."
"262" "READ" "The bucket of bolts will never get us through this blockade."
"263" "HAN" "This baby still has some surprises in it, honey."
"264" "HAN" "Come on! Come on! Change. Let's hope we don't have a burnout."
"265" "HAN" "See?"
"266" "READ" "Someday you're going to make a mistake, and I hope I'm there to see it."
"267" "HAN" "Punch!"
"268" "LUKE" "Artoo! Prepare her for takeoff."
"269" "WEDGE" "Good luck, Luke. See you at the date."
"270" "LUKE" "Don't worry, Artoo. We're coming, we're coming."
"271" "LUKE" "Nothing's wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a new course."
"272" "LUKE" "We will not regroup with the others."
"273" "LUKE" "We're heading to the Dagobah system."
"274" "LUKE" "Yes, Artoo?"
"275" "LUKE" "Okay. I'd like to keep you on manual control for a while."
"276" "HAN" "I saw them! I saw them!"
"277" "READ" "See what?"
"278" "HAN" "Star Destroyers, two of them, heading straight for us."
"279" "THREEPIO" "Sir, sir! May I suggest..."
"280" "HAN" "Shut it up or shut it down! Check the deflector shield!"
"281" "HAN" "Ah, great. Well, we can still beat them."
"282" "IMPERIAL OFFICER" "Take evasive action!"
"283" "HAN" "Prepare to jump to the speed of light."

"286" "HAN" "Oh yeah? Check this out."
"287" "READ" "Watch what?"
"288" "HAN" "I think we're in trouble."
"289" "THREEPIO" "If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator was damaged. It's impossible to go at the speed of light!"
"290" "HAN" "We're in trouble!"
"291" "HAN" "Horizontal reinforcements...!"
"292" "HAN" "Alluvial buffers...! Well, that's not it."
"293" "HAN" "Bring me the hydraulic wrenches!"
"294" "HAN" "I don't know how we're going to get out of this."
"295" "HAN" "Oww! Chewie!"
"296" "HAN" "That wasn't a laser blast! Something hit us."
"297" "READ" "Han, get up here!"
"298" "HAN" "Come on, Chewie!"
"299" "READ" "Asteroids!"
"300" "HAN" "Oh no! Chewie, put it two-seven-one."
"301" "READ" "What are you doing? Aren't you actually walking into an asteroid field?"
"302" "HAN" "They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?"
"303" "READ" "You don't have to do that to impress me."
"304" "THREEPIO" "Sir, the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid field are approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one."
"305" "HAN" "Never tell me the odds!"
"306" "HAN" "You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well, that might be it, honey."
"307" "READ" "I take it back. We'll get pulverized if we stay here much longer."
"308" "HAN" "I won't argue with that."
"309" "THREEPIO" "Sprayed?"
"310" "HAN" "I'm going to get close to one of the big ones."
"311" "READ" "Closer?"
"312" "THREEPIO" "Closer?!"
"313" "THREEPIO" "Ah, that's suicide!"
"314" "HAN" "There. It looks really good."
"315" "READ" "What looks really good?"
"316" "HAN" "Yes. That will do fine."
"317" "THREEPIO" "Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?"
"318" "READ" "I hope you know what you're doing."
"319" "HAN" "Yes, me too."
"320" "LUKE" "Yes, that's it. Dagobah."
"321" "LUKE" "No, I'm not changing my mind about that. I'm not taking any cities or technology. Massive life form readings, though. There's something alive down there..."
"322" "LUKE" "Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids."
"323" "LUKE" "I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't see anything! Just wait, I'll start the landing cycle..."
"324" "LUKE" "No, Artoo, stay there. I'll take a look."
"325" "LUKE" "Artoo?"
"326" "LUKE" "Artoo! Where are you?"
"327" "LUKE" "Artoo! Be more careful."
"328" "LUKE" "Artoo -- that way!"
"329" "LUKE" "Artoo!"
"330" "LUKE" "Oh no! Are you okay? Come on. You're lucky it doesn't taste too good. Anything broken?"
"331" "LUKE" "If you're saying that coming here was a bad idea, I'm starting to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, me I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
"332" "VADER" "Yes, Admiral?"
"333" "PIETT" "Our ships have spotted the Millennium Falcon, sir. But... it has entered an asteroid field and we can't risk it..."
"334" "VADER" "Asteroids don't worry me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses."
"335" "PIETT" "Yes, sir."
"336" "HAN" "I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems."
"337" "THREEPIO" "Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down too?"
"338" "HAN" "No, I need you to talk to Falcon, find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive."
"339" "THREEPIO" "Sir, it is quite possible that this asteroid is not entirely stable."
"340" "HAN" "Not quite stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these things. Chewie, take the professor in the back and turn him on the hyperdrive."
"341" "THREEPIO" "Ah! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm just trying to do my job in the best way..."
"342" "READ" "Let go."
"343" "HAN" "Sshh!"
"344" "READ" "Let go, please."
"345" "HAN" "Don't get excited."
"346" "READ" "Captain, being held by you isn't enough to turn me on."
"347" "HAN" "Sorry, honey. We don't have time for anything else."
"348" "LUKE" "Ready for some energy? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there. There you go."
"349" "LUKE" "Now all I have to do is find this Yoda... if he even exists."
"350" "LUKE" "Still... there's something familiar about this place. I feel like... I don't know..."
"351" "STRANGE VOICE" "Feel like what?"
"352" "LUKE" "Like we're being watched!"
"353" "CREATURE" "Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm."
"354" "CREATURE" "I'm wondering, why are you here?"
"355" "LUKE" "I'm looking for someone."
"356" "CREATURE" "Looking for? Found someone, do you have it, I would say, hmmm?"
"357" "LUKE" "Okay."
"358" "CREATURE" "I can help you. Yes, mmmm."
"359" "LUKE" "I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior."
"360" "CREATURE" "Ahhh! A great warrior. Wars don't make a great."
"361" "LUKE" "Put it down. Hey! That's my dinner."
"362" "CREATURE" "How do you get so big, eating food like that?"
"363" "LUKE" "Listen, friend, we didn't want to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you..."
"364" "CREATURE" "Ah, can't you get your ship out?"
"365" "LUKE" "Hey, you could have broken that. Don't do that. Ohhh... you're making a mess. Hey, give it to me!"
"366" "CREATURE" "Mine! Or I won't help you."
"367" "LUKE" "I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'm going to need it to get out of this slimy mess."
"368" "CREATURE" "Mudhole? Slimy? This is my home."
"369" "CREATURE" "Ah, ah, ah!"
"370" "LUKE" "Ah, Artoo, let him have it."
"371" "CREATURE" "Mine! Mine!"
"372" "LUKE" "Artoo!"
"373" "CREATURE" "Mine!"
"374" "CREATURE" "Mine!"
"375" "LUKE" "Now will you move on, little friend? We have a lot of work to do."
"376" "CREATURE" "No! No, no! Stay and help him, I will. Find your friend, hmm?"
"377" "LUKE" "I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master."
"378" "CREATURE" "Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda."
"379" "LUKE" "Do you know him?"
"380" "CREATURE" "Mmm. Take you to him, I will. Yes, yes. But now, we must eat. Come. Good food. Come."
"381" "CREATURE" "Come, come."
"382" "LUKE" "Stay here and take care of the camp, Artoo."
"383" "THREEPIO" "Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?"
"384" "THREEPIO" "Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you will have to replace it ."
"385" "HAN" "Well, of course I'll have to replace it."
"386" "HAN" "Here! And Chewie..."
"387" "HAN" "...I think it's best to replace the negative power coupling."
"388" "HAN" "Hey, Your Honor, I'm just trying to help."
"389" "READ" "Could you please stop calling me that?"
"390" "HAN" "Sure, Leia."
"391" "READ" "Ah, sometimes you make it so difficult."
"392" "HAN" "I like it, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm okay."
"393" "READ" "Occasionally maybe... when you're not acting like a creep."
"394" "HAN" "Scaundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that."
"395" "READ" "Stop it."
"396" "HAN" "Stop what?"
"397" "READ" "Stop it! My hands are dirty."
"398" "HAN" "My hands are dirty too. What are you afraid of?"
"399" "READ" "Scared?"
"400" "HAN" "You're shaking."
"401" "READ" "I'm not shaking."
"402" "HAN" "You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough scoundrels in your life."
"403" "READ" "I happen to like nice men."
"404" "HAN" "I'm a good man."
"405" "READ" "No, you're not. You're..."
"406" "THREEPIO" "Sir, sir! I have isolated the reverse power flow coupling."
"407" "HAN" "Thank you. Thank you very much."
"408" "THREEPIO" "Ah, you're welcome, sir."
"409" "NEEDA" "...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they appeared in any of our sights. Considering the amount of damage we took, they must have been destroyed."
"410" "VADER" "No, Captain, they are alive. I want all available ships to sweep the asteroid field until they are found."
"411" "PIETT" "Lord Vader."
"412" "VADER" "Yes, Admiral, what is it?"
"413" "PIETT" "The Emperor orders you to make contact with him."
"414" "VADER" "Move the ship out of the asteroid field so we can send a clear transmission."
"415" "PIETT" "Yes, my lord."
"416" "VADER" "What is your order, my master?"
"417" "EMPEROR" "There is a great disturbance in the Force."
"418" "VADER" "I felt it."
"419" "EMPEROR" "We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker."
"420" "VADER" "Yes, my master."
"421" "EMPEROR" "He could destroy us."
"422" "VADER" "He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can't help him anymore."
"423" "EMPEROR" "The Force is strong with him. Skywalker's son must not become a Jedi."
"424" "VADER" "If he could be transformed, he would become a powerful ally."
"425" "EMPEROR" "Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?"
"426" "VADER" "He will join us or die, my master."
"427" "LUKE" "Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda right now."
"428" "CREATURE" "Patience! For the Jedi it's time to eat too. Eat, eat. Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?"
"429" "LUKE" "How far away is Yoda? Will it take us a long time to get there?"
"430" "CREATURE" "Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him. Rootleaf, I cook. Why does he want you to become a Jedi? Hm?"
"431" "LUKE" "Mostly because of my dad, I guess."
"432" "CREATURE" "Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm."
"433" "LUKE" "Oh, come on. How can you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Oh, I don't even know what I'm doing here. We're wasting our time. ."
"434" "CREATURE" "I can't teach him. The boy has no patience."
"435" "BEN" "He will learn patience."
"436" "YODA" "Hmmm. Lots of anger in him, like his father."
"437" "BEN" "Was I different when you taught me?"
"438" "YODA" "Hah. He's not ready."
"439" "LUKE" "Yoda! I'm ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm ready."
"440" "YODA" "Ready, are you? What do you know? For eight hundred years I have trained Jedi. My own counsel I will keep as to who should be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one I watched a long time ago. Didn't care where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi doesn't crave such things. You're reckless!"
"441" "BEN" "Me too, if you remember."
"442" "YODA" "He's too old. Yes, too old to begin training."
"443" "LUKE" "But I learned so much."
"444" "YODA" "Will he finish what he started?"
"445" "LUKE" "I won't fail you - I'm not afraid."
"446" "YODA" "Oh, you will be. You will be."
"447" "THREEPIO" "Sir, if I may have an opinion..."
"448" "HAN" "I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio."
"449" "READ" "There's something out there."
"450" ​​"HAN" "Where?"
"451" "READ" "Outside, in the cave."

"453" "HAN" "I'm going outside."
"454" "READ" "Are you crazy?!"
"455" "HAN" "I just put this bucket together. I'm not going to let anything destroy it."
"456" "READ" "Then I'll go with you."
"457" "THREEPIO" "I think it would be better if I stayed here and guarded the ship. Oh, no."
"458" "READ" "That floor sure looks weird. It doesn't look like stone at all."
"459" "HAN" "There's a lot of humidity in here."
"460" "READ" "I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this."
"461" "HAN" "Yes."
"462" "HAN" "Careful!"
"463" "HAN" "Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of the ship, make sure there aren't any more trapped. They're chewing on the power cords."
"464" "READ" "Mynocks?"
"465" "HAN" "Go inside. We'll clean them up if there are any more."
"466" "THREEPIO" "Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Stupid thing. Shoo! Shoo!"
"467" "HAN" "Wait a minute..."
"468" "HAN" "Alright, Chewie, let's get out of here!"
"469" "READ" "The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise..."

"472" "READ" "You can't jump to the speed of light in this asteroid field..."
"473" "HAN" "Sit down, honey. We're taking off!"
"474" "THREEPIO" "Look!"

"476" "THREEPIO" "We are doomed!"
"477" "READ" "The cave is collapsing."
"478" "HAN" "This isn't a cave."
"479" "READ" "What?"
"480" "YODA" "Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force is them. Easily they flow, fast to join you in a fight. If once you begin the dark path, forever it will dominate your destiny, consume you, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice."
"481" "LUKE" "Vader. Is the dark side stronger?"
"482" "YODA" "No...no...no. Faster, easier, more seductive."
"483" "LUKE" "But how am I supposed to tell the good from the bad?"
"484" "YODA" "You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack."
"485" "LUKE" "But tell me why I can't..."
"486" "YODA" "No, no, there is no reason. I will teach you nothing more today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm."
"487" "LUKE" "Something's wrong here."
"488" "LUKE" "I feel cold, death."
"489" "YODA" "That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. It is a domain of evil. In you must go."
"490" "LUKE" "What's there?"
"491" "YODA" "Only what you take with you."
"492" "YODA" "Your weapons... you won't need them."
"493" "PIETT" "Bounty hunters. We don't need these scum."
"494" "FIRST CONTROLLER" "Yes, sir."
"495" "PIETT" "These rebels won't escape us."
"496" "SECOND CONTROLLER" "Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger."
"497" "PIETT" "Okay."
"498" "VADER" "...there will be a substantial reward for whoever finds the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use whatever methods necessary, but I want them alive. No disintegrations."
"499" "BOBA FETT" "As you wish."
"500" "PIETT" "Lord Vader! My lord, we have them."
"501" "THREEPIO" "Ah, thank God we're leaving the asteroid field."
"502" "HAN" "Let's get out of here. Ready for light speed? One...two...three!"

"504" "HAN" "The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!"
"505" "READ" "No light speed?"
"506" "HAN" "It's not my fault."
"507" "THREEPIO" "Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit to the rear quarter and we're finished."
"508" "HAN" "Turn it over."
"509" "HAN" "I said turn her around! I'll put all the power into the front shield."
"510" "READ" "Are you going to attack them?!"
"511" "THREEPIO" "Sir, the chances of surviving a direct attack on an Imperial Star Destroyer..."
"512" "READ" "Shut up!"
"513" "NEEDA" "They are moving into attack position. Shields up!"
"514" "NEEDA" "Track them. They might show up for another pass."
"515" "TRACKING OFFICER" "Captain Needa, the ship is no longer in our sights."
"516" "NEEDA" "They can't be gone. No ship that small has a cloaking device."
"517" "TRACKING OFFICER" "Well, there's no trace of them, sir."
"518" "COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER" "Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit."
"519" "NEEDA" "Prepare a shuttlecraft. I will take full responsibility for losing it, and I apologize to Lord Vader. In the meantime, continue searching the area."
"520" "COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER" "Yes, Captain Needa."
"521" "YODA" "Use the Force. Yes..."
"522" "YODA" "Now... the stone. Feel it."
"523" "YODA" "Focus!"
"524" "LUKE" "Oh no. We're never going to release it now."
"525" "YODA" "So right you are. Always with you can't be done. Didn't you hear anything I said?"
"526" "LUKE" "Master, moving rocks is one thing. This is entirely different."
"527" "YODA" "No! It's not different! Just different in your mind. You must unlearn what you've learned."
"528" "LUKE" "Okay, I'll try."
"529" "YODA" "No! Don't try. Do. Or don't. There is no try."
"530" "LUKE" "I can't. It's too big."
"531" "YODA" "Size doesn't matter. Look at me. Judge me by my size, won't you? Hm? Mmmm."
"532" "YODA" "And well, you shouldn't. To my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ...not this raw matter. You must feel the Force all around you. Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this earth and that ship!"
"533" "LUKE" "You want the impossible."
"534" "LUKE" "I don't... I don't believe it."
"535" "YODA" "That's why you fail."
"536" "VADER" "Apology accepted, Captain Needa."
"537" "PIETT" "Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and have found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon entered at the speed of light, it will already be on the other side of the galaxy."
"538" "VADER" "Alert all commands. Calculate all possible destinations along its last known trajectory."
"539" "PIETT" "Yes, my lord. We will find them."
"540" "VADER" "Don't fail me again, Admiral."
"541" "PIETT" "Alert all commands. Deploy fleet."
"542" "THREEPIO" "Captain Solo, this time you've gone too far. No, I won't keep quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?"
"543" "HAN" "The fleet is beginning to disintegrate. Go back and wait for the manual release of the landing claw."
"544" "THREEPIO" "I really don't see how that will help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire might be kind enough..."
"545" "HAN" "Thank you."
"546" "READ" "What do you have in mind for your next move?"
"547" "HAN" "Well, if they follow standard Empire procedure, they'll dump the trash before going to light speed, so we just float away."
"548" "READ" "With the rest of the trash. And then?"
"549" "HAN" "So we have to find a safe haven somewhere around here. Do you have any ideas?"
"550" "READ" "No. Where are we?"
"551" "HAN" "The Anoat system."
"552" "READ" "Anoat System. Not much there."
"553" "HAN" "No. Well, wait. That's interesting. Lando."
"554" "READ" "Lando System?"
"555" "HAN" "Lando is not a system, he is a man. Lando Calrissian. He is a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You would like him."
"556" "READ" "Thank you."
"557" "HAN" "Bespin. It's a long way away, but I think we can do it."
"558" "READ" "A mining colony?"
"559" "HAN" "Yes, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando tricked someone. We go back a long way, Lando and I."
"560" "READ" "Can you trust him?"

"563" "READ" "You have your moments. Not many, but you have them."
"564" "YODA" "Concentrate... feel the flow of the Force. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future... the past. Old friends meet they were."
"565" "LUKE" "Han! Read it!"
"566" "YODA" "Hmm. Control, control. You must learn to control."
"567" "LUKE" "I saw... I saw a city in the clouds."
"568" "YODA" "Mmm. Friends you have there."
"569" "LUKE" "They were in pain."
"570" "YODA" "It's the future you see."
"571" "LUKE" "Future? Will they die?"
"572" "YODA" "Hard to see. Always in motion is the future."
"573" "LUKE" "I have to go to them."
"574" "YODA" "Decide how you should serve them best. If you leave now, help them that you could. But you would destroy everything they have fought and suffered for."
"575" "HAN" "No, I don't have landing clearance. I'm trying to talk to Lando Calrissian."
"576" "HAN" "Wow! Wait a minute! Let me explain."

"590" "HAN" "See? My friend. Keep your eyes open, okay?"
"591" "LANDO" "Why, you slimy, backstabbing, worthless crook! You've got a lot of nerve coming here, after what you've pulled."
"592" "LANDO" "How are you, you old pirate? It's good to see you! I never thought I'd meet you again. Where have you been?"
"593" "THREEPIO" "Well, he seems very friendly."
"594" "READ" "Yes... very nice."

"597" "LANDO" "What did you do to my ship?"
"598" "HAN" "Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost it to me fair and square."
"599" "LANDO" "Hello. What do we have here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm the administrator of this facility. And who might you be?"
"600" "READ" "Read."
"601" "LANDO" "Welcome, Leia."
"602" "HAN" "Alright, alright, you old beater."
"603" "THREEPIO" "Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facility is at your..."
"604" "THREEPIO" "Well, really!"
"605" "LANDO" "What's wrong with the Falcon?"
"606" "HAN" "Hyperdrive."
"607" "LANDO" "I'll get my people to work on it."
"608" "HAN" "Good."
"609" "LANDO" "You know, that ship saved my life a few times. She's the fastest piece of junk in the galaxy."
"610" "HAN" "How's the gas mine? Is it worth it for you?"
"611" "LANDO" "Ah, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of all kinds. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?"
"612" "HAN" "You. Listen to you - you look like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who would have thought that, huh?"
"613" "LANDO" "You know, seeing you sure brings some things back."
"614" "HAN" "Yes."
"615" "LANDO" "Yes, I'm responsible these days. It's the price you pay for success."
"616" "THREEPIO" "Ah! It's good to see a familiar face."
"617" "SECOND THREE EPIOS" "And kick!"
"618" "THREEPIO" "How rude!"

"621" "MAN" "Who are you?"
"622" "THREEPIO" "Oh, I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!"
"623" "YODA" "Luke! You must complete the training."
"624" "LUKE" "I can't get the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I have to help them."
"625" "YODA" "You must not go!"
"626" "LUKE" "But Han and Leia will die if I don't."
"627" "BEN" "You don't know that."
"628" "BEN" "Even Yoda cannot see their fate."
"629" "LUKE" "But I can help them! I feel the Force!"
"630" "BEN" "But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
"631" "YODA" "Yes, yes. For Obi-Wan you hear. The cave. Remember your failure in the cave!"
"632" "LUKE" "But I've learned a lot since then. Master Yoda, I promise to come back and finish what I started. You have my word."
"633" "BEN" "It's you and your skills that the Emperor wants. That's why your friends are made to suffer."
"634" "LUKE" "And that's why I have to go."
"635" "BEN" "Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader."
"636" "LUKE" "You won't."
"637" "YODA" "They must be still. It depends. Only a Jedi Knight fully trained with the Force as your ally will win over Vader and his Emperor. If you finish your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did , you will become an agent of evil."
"638" "BEN" "Patience."
"639" "LUKE" "And sacrifice Han and Leia?"
"640" "YODA" "If you honor what they fight for... yes!"
"641" "BEN" "If you choose to face Vader, you will do so alone. I cannot interfere."
"642" "LUKE" "I see. Artoo, turn on the converters."
"643" "BEN" "Luke, don't give in to hate - it leads to the dark side."
"644" "YODA" "Strong is Vader. Be careful what you learn. Save you may."
"645" "LUKE" "I will. And I will come back. I promise."
"646" "YODA" "I told you, I told you. He's reckless. Now things are worse."
"647" "BEN" "This boy is our last hope."
"648" "YODA" "No. There is another."
"649" "HAN" "The ship is almost ready. Two or three more things and we're in great shape."
"650" "READ" "The sooner the better. Something is wrong here. No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to be lost."

"652" "READ" "I don't trust Lando."

"660" "LANDO" "Sorry. Am I interrupting something?"
"661" "READ" "Not really."
"662" "LANDO" "You look absolutely beautiful. You really belong here with us among the clouds."
"663" "READ" "Thank you."
"664" "LANDO" "Can you join me for refreshment?"
"665" "LANDO" "Everyone is invited, of course."
"666" "LANDO" "Having trouble with your droid?"
"667" "HAN" "No. No problem. Why?"
"668" "LANDO" "So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall under the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire."
"669" "READ" "So you're part of the mining guild?"
"670" "LANDO" "No, not really. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is a win-win, as our customers are eager to avoid drawing attention to themselves."
"671" "HAN" "Aren't you afraid that the Empire will find out about this little operation and shut you down?"
"672" "LANDO" "This has always been a danger hanging like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed to ensure safety. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever."
"673" "VADER" "We would be honored if you would join us."
"674" "LANDO" "I had no choice. They got there way before you. I'm sorry."
"675" "HAN" "I'm sorry too."
"676" "LUKE" "No, Threepio is with them."
"677" "LUKE" "Hang on. We're almost there."
"678" "THREEPIO" "Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take it off! I, uh, don't want to intrude here. I, no, no, no, no... Please don't get up. No!”
"679" "THREEPIO" "Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!"
"680" "LANDO" "Lord Vader."
"681" "VADER" "You can take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker."
"682" "BOBA FETT" "He's no good to me dead."
"683" "VADER" "He will suffer no permanent damage."
"684" "LANDO" "Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?"
"685" "VADER" "They must never leave this city again."
"686" "LANDO" "That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to that bounty hunter!"
"687" "VADER" "Perhaps you think you are being treated unfairly."
"688" "LANDO" "No."
"689" "VADER" "Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here."
"690" "LANDO" "This thing is getting worse and worse."
"691" "THREEPIO" "Oh, yes, that's very good. I like it. Oh! Something's not right 'cause now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm behind, you stupid furball. Only a knucklehead like you would be stupid enough..."
"692" "HAN" "I feel terrible."
"693" "READ" "Why are they doing this?"
"694" "HAN" "They never asked me any questions."
"695" "READ" "Lando."
"696" "HAN" "Get out of here, Lando!"
"697" "LANDO" "Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to hand over Leia and Chewie to me."
"698" "HAN" "For you?"
"699" "LANDO" "They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe."
"700" "READ" "What about Han?"
"701" "LANDO" "Vader is giving him to the bounty hunter."
"702" "READ" "Vader wants us all dead."
"703" "LANDO" "He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker."
"704" "HAN" "Luke?"
"705" "LANDO" "Lord Vader has set a trap for him."
"706" "READ" "And we are the bait."
"707" "LANDO" "Well, he's on his way."
"708" "HAN" "Perfect. You fixed us all up nicely, didn't you? My friend!"
"709" "LANDO" "Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I didn't do better, but I have my own problems."
"710" "HAN" "Yes, you are a true hero."
"711" "READ" "You certainly have a way with people."
"712" "VADER" "This facility is rudimentary, but should be adequate to freeze Skywalker on his journey to the Emperor."
"713" "IMPERIAL SOLDIER" "Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class."
"714" "VADER" "Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land."
"715" "LANDO" "Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If you put him there, it could kill him."
"716" "VADER" "I don't want the Emperor's prize to be damaged. Let's test it... on Captain Solo."
"717" "THREEPIO" "If you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish."
"718" "HAN" "What's going on... friend?"
"719" "LANDO" "You are being placed in carbon freeze."
"720" "BOBA FETT" "What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me."
"721" "VADER" "The Empire will compensate him if he dies. Put him here!"
"722" "THREEPIO" "Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!"
"723" "HAN" "Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!"
"724" "THREEPIO" "Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die."
"725" "HAN" "Chewie! Chewie, this isn't going to help me. Hey!"
"726" "HAN" "Save your strength. There will be another time. The princess - you have to take care of her. Do you hear me?"
"727" "READ" "I love you!"
"728" "HAN" "I know."
"729" "THREEPIO" "What... what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite. He should be well protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is."
"730" "VADER" "Well, Calrissian, did he survive?"
"731" "LANDO" "Yes, he is alive. And in perfect hibernation."
"732" "VADER" "He's all your bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker."
"733" "IMPERIAL OFFICER" "Skywalker has just disembarked, my lord."
"734" "VADER" "Good. Make him find his way here. Calrissian, take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship."
"735" "LANDO" "You said they would be left in town under my supervision."
"736" "VADER" "I'm changing the agreement. Please don't change it anymore."
"737" "READ" "Luke! Luke, no -- it's a trap! It's a trap!"
"738" "VADER" "The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not yet a Jedi."
"739" "LANDO" "Very well. Hold them to the security tower - and stay still. Move."
"740" "READ" "What do you think you're doing?"
"741" "LANDO" "Let's get out of here."
"742" "THREEPIO" "I knew all along it had to be a mistake."
"743" "READ" "Do you think that after what you did to Han we will trust you?"
"744" "LANDO" "I had no choice..."
"745" "THREEPIO" "What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!"
"746" "READ" "Ah, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice."
"747" "LANDO" "I'm just trying to help..."
"748" "READ" "We don't need your help."
"749" "LANDO" "Haaa..."
"750" "READ" "What?"
"751" "THREEPIO" "It looks like Han."
"752" "LANDO" "There's still a chance to save Han... I mean, on the East Platform..."
"753" "READ" "Chewie."
"754" "THREEPIO" "I'm sorry about all this. After all, he's just a Wookiee."
"755" "BOBA FETT" "Place Captain Solo in the cargo hold."
"756" "THREEPIO" "Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?"
"757" "THREEPIO" "Turn around, you furry...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!"
"758" "THREEPIO" "Well, at least you're still in one piece! Look what happened to me!"
"759" "THREEPIO" "Oh no! Chewie, they're after you!"
"760" "VADER" "You've learned a lot, young man."
"761" "LUKE" "You'll find that I'm full of surprises."
"762" "VADER" "Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be true."
"763" "LUKE" "No!"
"764" "VADER" "Very easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought."
"765" "VADER" "Impressive... more impressive."
"766" "VADER" "Obi-Wan taught you well. You controlled your fear... now release your anger."
"767" "VADER" "Only your hatred can destroy me."
"768" "LANDO" "Security codes have been changed!"
"769" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system."
"770" "LANDO" "Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has taken control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive."
"771" "LANDO" "This way."
"772" "THREEPIO" "Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I shouldn't know a socket from a computer terminal."
"773" "THREEPIO" "What are you talking about? We're not interested in the Millennium Falcon's hyperdrive. It's fixed! Just open the door, you idiot."
"774" "THREEPIO" "I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!"
"775" "THREEPIO" "Ow! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Get down, you thoughtless... Ow!"
"776" "LANDO" "Leia! Go!"
"777" "THREEPIO" "I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I look better."
"778" "VADER" "You are defeated. It is futile to resist. Don't let yourself be destroyed like Obi-Wan did."
"779" "VADER" "There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You have not yet realized your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can finish with this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
"780" "LUKE" "I'll never join you!"
"781" "VADER" "If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father."
"782" "LUKE" "He told me enough! He told me you killed him."
"783" "VADER" "No. I am your father."
"784" "LUKE" "No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!"
"785" "VADER" "Search your feelings. You know it's true."
"786" "LUKE" "No! No! No!"
"787" "VADER" "Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He foresaw it. It is your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son. Come with me. It is the only way."
"788" "LUKE" "Ben...Ben, please!"
"789" "LUKE" "Ben. Read it!"
"790" "LUKE" "Listen to me! Read!"
"791" "READ" "Luke... We have to go back."
"792" "LANDO" "What?"
"793" "READ" "I know where Luke is."
"794" "LANDO" "But what about those fighters?"
"795" "READ" "Chewie, just do it."
"796" "LANDO" "But what about Vader?"
"797" "LANDO" "Alright, alright, alright."
"798" "VADER" "Bring my shuttle."
"799" "LANDO" "Look, there's someone up there."
"800" "READ" "It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and let's get under him. Lando, open the top hatch."
"801" "READ" "Okay. Easy, Chewie."
"802" "READ" "Lando?"
"803" "LANDO" "Okay, let's go."
"804" "LUKE" "Ah, Leia."
"805" "LANDO" "Alright, Chewie. Let's go."
"806" "READ" "I'll be right back."
"807" "LEIA" "Star Destroyer."
"808" "LANDO" "Alright, Chewie. Ready for light speed."
"809" "READ" "If your people fixed the hyperdrive."
"810" "READ" "All coordinates are set. It's now or never."
"811" "LANDO" "Punch!"
"812" "LANDO" "They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not my fault!"
"813" "PIETT" "They'll be within our tractor beam range in moments, sir."
"814" "VADER" "Your men disabled the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon?"
"815" "PIETT" "Yes, my lord."
"816" "VADER" "Good. Prepare the boarding party and ready your weapons to stun."
"817" "PIETT" "Yes, my lord."
"818" "THREEPIO" "Noisy brute. Why don't we go to light speed?"
"819" "THREEPIO" "Can't we? How do you know the hyperdrive is disabled?"
"820" "THREEPIO" "Did the city's central computer tell you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!"
"821" "VADER" "Luke."
"822" "LUKE" "Dad."
"823" "VADER" "Son, come with me."
"824" "LUKE" "Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
"825" "LANDO" "Chewie!"
"826" "LUKE" "It's Vader."
"827" "VADER" "Luke...it's your destiny."
"828" "LUKE" "Ben, why didn't you tell me?"
"829" "PIETT" "Alert all commands. Ready for tractor beam."
"830" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, come back already! You're not done with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!"
"831" "THREEPIO" "Ah, you did it!"
"832" "LANDO" "Luke, we're ready for takeoff."
"833" "LUKE" "Good luck, Lando"
"834" "LANDO" "When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty hunter, we'll contact you."
"835" "LUKE" "I'll meet you at the meeting point on Tatooine."
"836" "LANDO" "Princess, we'll find Han. I promise."
"837" "LUKE" "Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal."
"838" "LUKE" "Be careful, you two. May the Force be with you."
"839" "LUKE" "Ouch!"
