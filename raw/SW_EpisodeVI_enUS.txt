"1" "SHUTTLE CAPTAIN" "Command station, this is ST 321. Code Blue Clearance. We are initiating our approach. Disable security shield."
"2" "DEATH STAR CONTROLLER" "The security deflector shield will deactivate when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Please wait... You are clear to proceed."
"3" "SHUTTLE CAPTAIN" "We are beginning our approach."
"4" "OFFICER" "Inform the commander that Lord Vader's ship has arrived."
"5" "OPERATOR" "Yes, sir."
"6" "JERGERROD" "Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We are honored by your presence."
"7" "VADER" "You can dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to get you back on schedule."
"8" "JERJERROD" "I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can."
"9" "VADER" "Maybe I can find new ways to motivate them."
"10" "JERJERROD" "I tell you, this station will be operational as planned."
"11" "VADER" "The Emperor does not share your optimistic assessment of the situation."
"12" "JERJERROD" "But he asks the impossible. I need more men."
"13" "VADER" "Then maybe you can tell him when he arrives."
"14" "JERJERROD" "Is the Emperor coming here?"
"15" "VADER" "Correct, Commander. And he is very unhappy with your apparent lack of progress."
"16" "JERJERROD" "We will double our efforts."
"17" "VADER" "I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am."
"18" "THREEPIO" "Of course I'm worried. And you should be too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never came back from this horrible place."
"19" "THREEPIO" "Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short circuit."
"20" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I'd better knock, I suppose."
"21" "THREEPIO" "It looks like there's no one there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke."
"22" "STRANGE VOICE" "Tee kicks what hey!"
"23" "THREEPIO" "God give me grace!"
"24" "THREEPIO" "Artoo Detoowha bo See three piowha hey very strange mischka Jabba du Hutt."
"25" "THREEPIO" "I don't think they'll let us in, Artoo. We'd better go."
"26" "THREE" "Artoo, wait. Oh, honey! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this."
"27" "THREEPIO" "Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!"
"28" "THREEPIO" "Just deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my God! Oh! Oh, no."
"29" "BIB" "Die Wanna Wanga!"
"30" "THREEPIO" "Oh, my God! Wauaga. We - we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt."
"31" "THREEPIO" "...and a gift. Gift, what gift?"
"32" "BIB" "Nee Jabba no badda . Chaade me how good."
"33" "THREEPIO" "He says our instructions are to be given only to Jabba himself."
"34" "THREEPIO" "I'm sorry. I'm afraid he's so stubborn about this kind of thing."
"35" "BIB" " Nudd Chaa."
"36" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this."
"37" "THREEPIO" "Good morning."
"38" "JABBA" "Bo Shuda !"
"39" "THREEPIO" "The message, Artoo, the message."
"40" "LUKE" "Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend of Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, powerful Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I am confident that we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial and allows us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As proof of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids."
"41" "THREEPIO" "What did he say?"
"42" "LUKE" "...They are both hardworking and will serve you well."
"43" "THREEPIO" "That can't be! Artoo, you're sending the wrong message."
"44" "JABBA" "There will be no bargaining."
"45" "THREEPIO" "We are doomed."
"46" "JABBA" "I'm not giving up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is."
"47" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite."
"48" "THREEPIO" "What could have happened to Master Luke. Was it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Wait! Ohh!"
"49" "NINEDENINE" "Ah, good. New acquisitions. You're a protocol droid, aren't you?"
"50" "THREEPIO" "I am See-Threepio, human-cy..."
"51" "NINEDENINE" "Yes or no."
"52" "THREEPIO" "Ah. Well, yes."
"53" "NINEDENINE" "How many languages ​​do you speak?"
"54" "THREEPIO" "I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily..."
"55" "NINEDENINE" "Splendid! We've been without an interpreter since our master got mad at our last protocol droid and disintegrated it."
"56" "THREEPIO" "Disintegrated?"
"57" "NINEDENINE" "Guard! This protocol droid could be useful. Encase it with a containment bolt and take it back to His Excellency's main audience chamber."
"58" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!"
"59" "NINEDENINE" "You're a feisty child, but you'll soon learn some respect. I need you on the master's Sailing Boat. And I think you'll fit in very well."
"60" "JABBA" "Da Eitha!"
"61" "OOLA" "Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota ..."
"62" "JABBA" "Boscka!"
"63" "BOUSHH" "I came for the reward for this Wookiee."
"64" "THREEPIO" "Oh no! Chewbacca!"
"65" "JABBA" "We finally have the mighty Chewbacca."
"66" "THREEPIO" "Oh, uh, yes, uh, I'm here, Your Excellency. Uh... yes!"
"67" "THREEPIO" "Oh. The illustrious Jabba welcomes you and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand."
"68" "BOUSHH" "I want fifty thousand. No less."
"69" "THREEPIO" "Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand."
"70" "THREEPIO" "Because he's holding a thermal detonator."
"71" "JABBA" "This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive."
"72" "THREEPIO" "Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you accept."
"73" "BOUSHH" "Zeebuss."
"74" "THREEPIO" "He agrees!"
"75" "BOUSHH" "Just relax for a moment. You are free of the carbonite."
"76" "BOUSHH" "Shhh. You have hibernation sickness."
"77" "HAN" "I can't see."
"78" "BOUSHH" "Your vision will return in time."
"79" "HAN" "Where am I?"
"80" "BOUSHH" "Jabba's Palace."
"81" "HAN" "Who are you?"
"82" "READ" "Someone who loves you."
"83" "HAN" "Read!"
"84" "READ" "I have to get you out of here."
"85" "HAN" "What's that? I know that laugh."
"86" "HAN" "Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was going to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault."
"87" "JABBA" "It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha fodder."
"88" "HAN" "Look..."
"89" "JABBA" "Take him away!"
"90" "HAN" "Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be foolish!"
"91" "JABBA" "Bring her to me."
"92" "READ" "We have powerful friends. You will regret this..."
"93" "JABBA" "I'm sure."
"94" "READ" "Ugh!"
"95" "THREEPIO" "Ohhh, I can't bear to watch."
"96" "HAN" "Chewie? Chewie, is that you?"
"97" "HAN" "Ah! Chew--Chewie!"
"98" "HAN" "Wait. I can't see, friend. What's going on?"
"99" "HAN" "Luke? Luke is crazy. He can't even take care of himself, let alone rescue someone."
"100" "HAN" "Um... Jedi Knight? I - I've been out of it for a while, everyone has delusions of grandeur."
"101" "HAN" "I'm fine, buddy. I'm fine."
"102" "LUKE" "I need to talk to Jabba."
"103" "LUKE" "You're going to take me to Jabba now!"
"104" "LUKE" "You serve your master well."
"105" "LUKE" "And you will be rewarded."
"106" "THREEPIO" "Finally! Master Luke has come to rescue me."
"107" "BIB" "Master."
"108" "BIB" "...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight."
"109" "JABBA" "I told you not to admit it."
"110" "LUKE" "I must be allowed to speak."
"111" "BIB" "He should be able to talk."
"112" "JABBA" "You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick."
"113" "LUKE" "You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me."
"114" "JABBA" "Your mental powers won't work on me, boy."
"115" "LUKE" "Still, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can profit from this... or be destroyed! The choice is yours. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers."
"116" "THREEPIO" "Master Luke, you are standing..."
"117" "JABBA" "There will be no bargaining, young Jedi. I will enjoy watching you die."
"118" "JABBA" "Enough!"
"119" "THREEPIO" "Oh no! The Grudge!"
"120" "JABBA" "Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage."
"121" "LUKE" "Han!"
"122" "HAN" "Luke!"
"123" "LUKE" "Are you okay?"
"124" "HAN" "Okay. Together again, huh?"
"125" "LUKE" "I wouldn't miss it."
"126" "HAN" "How are we?"
"127" "LUKE" "Same as always."
"128" "HAN" "So bad, huh? Where's Leia?"
"129" "READ" "I'm here."
"130" "THREEPIO" "Oh, dear. His High Exaltation, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you must be exterminated immediately."
"131" "HAN" "Well, I hate long waits."
"132" "THREEPIO" "You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the almighty Sarlacc."
"133" "HAN" "It doesn't look so bad."
"134" "THREEPIO" "In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years."
"135" "HAN" "On second thought, let's pass it on, huh?"
"136" "LUKE" "You should have negotiated, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make."
"137" "HAN" "I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big blur of light."
"138" "LUKE" "There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know."
"139" "HAN" "You're going to die here, you know. Convenient."
"140" "LUKE" "Just stay close to Chewie and Lando. I took care of everything."
"141" "HAN" "Ah... great!"
"142" "JABBA" "Soon you will learn to appreciate me."
"143" "THREEPIO" "Ah, I'm so sorry... Artoo! What are you doing here?"
"144" "THREEPIO" "Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke, and if we're not careful, so will we!"
"145" "THREEPIO" "Hmm. I wish I had your trust."
"146" "THREEPIO" "Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But if any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now hear your pleas."
"147" "HAN" " Trêspio, tell that slimy piece of... worm-filled filth that he won't get as much pleasure from us. OK?"
"148" "LUKE" "Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die."
"149" "JABBA" "Move it into position."
"150" "JABBA" "Put him in."
"151" "LUKE" "Calm down, Chewie."
"152" "LANDO" "Hey! Hey! Help!"
"153" "HAN" "Chewie, are you okay? Where is he?"
"154" "HAN" "I'm fine, buddy."
"155" "LANDO" "Han! Chewie?"
"156" "HAN" "Lando!"
"157" "HAN" "Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?"
"158" "HAN" "Lando, take it!"
"159" "LANDO" "Down!"
"160" "HAN" "I'm trying!"
"161" "HAN" "Hey! Hey! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping."
"162" "HAN" "Grab! L-- Lando. Grab!"
"163" "HAN" "Grab it! Almost... You almost made it!"
"164" "LANDO" "Wait! Wow!"
"165" "HAN" "Gently now. All... all right. Easy, easy now. Hold me, Chewie."
"166" "HAN" "Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando."
"167" "LANDO" "No, wait! I thought you were blind!"
"168" "HAN" "It's okay. Trust me. Don't move."
"169" "LANDO" "Okay! A little louder! Just a little louder!"
"170" "HAN" "Chewie, pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!"
"171" "READ" "Come on. We have to get out of here quickly."
"172" "THREEPIO" "Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!"
"173" "LUKE" "Take the gun! Aim for the deck!"
"174" "LUKE" "Aim for the deck!"
"175" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't jump."
"176" "LUKE" "Let's go!"
"177" "LUKE" "Come on! And don't forget the droids."
"178" "LANDO" "We're on our way."
"179" "HAN" "I don't know. All I can see is a bunch of blown sand!"
"180" "READ" "That's all any of us can see."
"181" "HAN" "Then I think I'm getting better."
"182" "HAN" "I gotta admit, kid, you were pretty good out there."
"183" "LUKE" "I had a lot of help. Don't think about anything."
"184" "HAN" "No, I'm thinking about it a lot. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to death there is. And it wasn't just sleeping. It was a big waking nothingness!"
"185" "LUKE" "See you at the fleet."
"186" "HAN" "Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?"
"187" "LUKE" "I have a promise I must keep first... with an old friend."
"188" "HAN" "I guess I owe you some thanks too, Lando."
"189" "LANDO" "I figured if I left you frozen like that you'd only give me bad luck for the rest of my life, so I'd better unfreeze you sooner or later."
"190" "READ" "He means You're welcome."
"191" "LANDO" "Come on, let's get out of this miserable ball of dust."
"192" "LUKE" "Meet you at the fleet."
"193" "READ" "Quick. The Alliance should already be assembled."
"194" "LUKE" "I will."
"195" "HAN" "Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for coming after me. Now I owe you one."
"196" "LUKE" "That's right, Artoo. We're heading to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... with an old friend."
"197" "EMPEROR" "Stand up, my friend."
"198" "VADER" "The Death Star will be completed on schedule."
"199" "EMPEROR" "You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense that you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker."
"200" "VADER" "Yes, my Master."
"201" "EMPEROR" "Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown stronger. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force . . ."
"202" "VADER" "As you wish."
"203" "EMPEROR" "Everything is happening as I predicted."
"204" "YODA" "Hmm. That face you make. Do I look that old to young eyes?"
"205" "LUKE" "No... of course not."
"206" "YODA" "Yes, yes! Sick I have become. Old and weak. When I reach nine hundred years old, I won't look so pretty. Hmm?"
"207" "YODA" "Soon I will rest. Yes, sleep forever. I have won, I have."
"208" "LUKE" "Master Yoda, you cannot die."
"209" "YODA" "Strong am I with the Force...but not too much! Dusk is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things...the way of the Force."
"210" "LUKE" "But I need your help. I came back to complete the training."
"211" "YODA" "You don't need any more training. You already know what you need."
"212" "LUKE" "So I'm a Jedi?"
"213" "YODA" " Ohhh . Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, will you be a Jedi. And you will face him."
"214" "LUKE" "Master Yoda... Is Darth Vader my father?"
"215" "YODA" " Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest."
"216" "LUKE" "Yoda, I need to know."
"217" "YODA" "Your father he is."
"218" "YODA" "Told you, didn't I?"
"219" "LUKE" "Yes."
"220" "YODA" "This is unexpected, and regrettable.."
"221" "LUKE" "Unhappy that I know the truth?"
"222" "YODA" "No. Unfortunately you rushed to face him... that training was incomplete. You were not ready for the burden."
"223" "LUKE" "Well, I'm sorry."
"224" "YODA" "Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side is them. Once you begin to walk the dark path, forever it will rule your destiny."
"225" "YODA" "Luke...Luke...No...Do not underestimate the Emperor's powers, or you will suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when I am gone I, the last of the Jedi you it will be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you've learned, Luke... There... is... another... Heaven... Heaven... Wanderer."
"226" "LUKE" "I can't do this, Artoo. I can't go on alone."
"227" "BEN" "Yoda will always be with you."
"228" "LUKE" "Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?"
"229" "LUKE" "You told me that Vader betrayed and murdered my father."
"230" "BEN" "Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He stopped being Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man that was your father was destroyed. So what did I tell you It was true... from a certain point of view."
"231" "LUKE" "A certain point of view!"
"232" "BEN" "Luke, you will discover that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."
"233" "BEN" "I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been the first time. See, what happened to your father was my fault."
"234" "BEN" "Anakin was a good friend."
"235" "BEN" "When I met him, his father was already a great pilot. But I was impressed by how strong the Force was with him. I decided to train him as a Jedi. I thought I could instruct him as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride had dire consequences for the galaxy."
"236" "LUKE" "There's still good in him."
"237" "BEN" "I also thought he could turn to the good side. It couldn't be done. He's more machine now than man. Twisted and evil."
"238" "LUKE" "I can't do this, Ben."
"239" "BEN" "You cannot escape your fate."
"240" "LUKE" "I tried to stop him once. I couldn't."
"241" "BEN" "Vader humiliated you when you met him, Luke... Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared."
"242" "LUKE" "But I had to help my friends."
"243" "BEN" "And you helped them? They were the ones who had to save you. You accomplished little by returning prematurely, I'm afraid."
"244" "LUKE" "I found out that Darth Vader was my father."
"245" "BEN" "To be a Jedi, Luke, you must face and go beyond the dark side - the side your father could not get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only , your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you stood your ground. You are no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!"
"246" "LUKE" "I can't kill my own father."
"247" "BEN" "So the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope."
"248" "LUKE" "Yoda spoke of another."
"249" "BEN" "The other one he talked about is your twin sister."
"250" "LUKE" "But I don't have a sister."
"251" "BEN" "Hmm. To protect you two from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, that if Anakin had children, they would be a threat to him. That's why your sister remains safely anonymous."
"252" "LUKE" "Leia! Leia is my sister."
"253" "BEN" "Your perception serves you well. Bury your feelings deep inside, Luke. They do you credit. But they can be made to serve the Emperor."
"254" "BEN" "When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep you two as safe as possible, for as long as possible. So I told you I took Leia to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and her mother took Leia to live as Senator Organa's daughter on Alderaan."
"255" "BEN" "The Organa family was well-born and politically quite powerful in that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of bloodline... no one knew she had been adopted, of course. But it was a title. without power royal, as Alderaan had long been a democracy. Still, the family continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her adoptive father's path, became a senator as well. That's not all she became, of course...she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a vital link in obtaining information for the Rebel cause. That's what she was doing when her path crossed yours... for her adoptive parents always told her to contact me on Tatooine if her problems became desperate."
"256" "LUKE" "But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her."
"257" "BEN" "She was not trained in the ways of the Jedi like you, Luke... You must face and destroy Vader!"
"258" "HAN" "Well, look at you, a general, huh?"
"259" "LANDO" "Ah, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver in the battle of Taanab."
"260" "HAN" "Well, don't look at me, friend. I just said you were a good pilot. I didn't know they were looking for someone to lead this crazy attack."
"261" "LANDO" "I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do that."
"262" "HAN" "Well, who said no. But I'm not crazy. You're the respectable one, remember?"
"263" "MON MOTHMA" "The Emperor has made a critical error and the time has come for our attack."
"264" "MON MOTHMA" "Data brought to us by Bothan spies indicates the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that this Death Star's weapons systems are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread across all over the galaxy in a vain effort to envelop us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we have learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star."
"265" "MON MOTHMA" "Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please."
"266" "ACKBAR" "You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor. Although this Death Star's weapons systems are not yet operational, the Death Star has a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the forest near Endor's Moon. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and try to knock it out of the main reactor."
"267" "ACKBAR" "General Calrissian volunteered to lead the fighter attack"
"268" "HAN" "Good luck."
"269" "HAN" "You'll need it."
"270" "ACKBAR" "General Madine."
"271" "GENERAL MADINE" "We have stolen a small Imperial ship. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and disable the shield generator."
"272" "THREEPIO" "It looks dangerous."
"273" "READ" "I wonder who they found to do this."
"274" "GENERAL MADINE" "General Solo, is your strike team assembled?"
"275" "HAN" "Uh, my team is ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle."
"276" "HAN" "Well, it's going to be difficult, friend. I didn't want to speak for you."
"277" "HAN" "It's one."
"278" "READ" "Uh, General...count me in."
"279" "VOICE" "I'm with you too!"
"280" "READ" "What is it?"
"281" "LUKE" "Ask me again sometime."
"282" "HAN" "Luke."
"283" "LUKE" "Hi, Han... Chewie."
"284" "THREEPIO" "\Exciting\ is hardly the word I would use."
"285" "HAN" "Look. I want you to take her. I'm serious. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet."
"286" "LANDO" "It's okay, old friend. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. Is that okay?"
"287" "HAN" "Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch."
"288" "LANDO" "Look, you can go, you pirate."
"289" "LANDO" "Good luck."
"290" "HAN" "You too."
"291" "HAN" "Did you warm her up?"
"292" "LUKE" "Yes, she's coming."
"293" "HAN" "No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed it, Chewie."
"294" "READ" "Hey, are you awake?"
"295" "HAN" "Yeah, I just have a funny feeling. Like I won't see her again."
"296" "READ" "Come on, general, let's go."
"297" "HAN" "Alright. Chewie, let's see what this piece of trash can do. Ready, guys?"
"298" "LUKE" "All ready."
"299" "THREEPIO" "Here we go again."
"300" "HAN" "Okay, wait."
"301" "VADER" "What is your order, my Master?"
"302" "EMPEROR" "Send the fleet to the other side of Endor. There it will remain until called."
"303" "VADER" "And the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?"
"304" "EMPEROR" "It is not a worry. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is done, my friend. Go to the command ship and await my orders."
"305" "VADER" "Yes, my Master."
"306" "HAN" "If they don't do this, we're going to have to get out of here real quick, Chewie."
"307" "CONTROLLER" "We have you on our screen now. Please identify yourself."
"308" "HAN" "Tydirium Shuttle requesting deflector shield deactivation."
"309" "CONTROLLER" "Shuttle Tydirium, transmit release code for shield pass."
"310" "HAN" "Transmission begins."
"311" "READ" "Now let's find out if that code is worth the price we paid."
"312" "HAN" "It'll work. It'll work."
"313" "LUKE" "Vader is on that ship."
"314" "HAN" "Now don't be nervous, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance."
"315" "HAN" "I don't know. Fly casual."
"316" "LUKE" "I'm putting the mission in danger. I shouldn't have come."
"317" "HAN" "It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here."
"318" "VADER" "Where is this ship going?"
"319" "PIETT" "Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?"
"320" "PILOT VOICE" "Parts and crew for the forest moon."
"321" "VADER" "Do they have a code clearance?"
"322" "PIETT" "It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them."
"323" "PIETT" "Should I hold them?"
"324" "VADER" "No. Leave them to me. I'll deal with them myself."
"325" "PIETT" "As you wish, my lord. Continue."
"326" "HAN" "They won't do that, Chewie."
"327" "CONTROLLER" "Shuttle Tydirium, shield deactivation will begin immediately. Follow your current course."
"328" "HAN" "Okay! I said it would work. No problem."
"329" "THREEPIO" "Ah, I told you it was dangerous here."
"330" "READ" "Shall we try to go for a walk?"
"331" "HAN" "It's going to take time. This whole party won't be worth anything if they see us."
"332" "HAN" "Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here."
"333" "LUKE" "Quietly, there might be more of them out there."
"334" "HAN" "Hey... it's me."
"335" "SCOUT #1" "Go get help! Go!"
"336" "LUKE" "Great. Let's go."
"337" "READ" "Over there! Two more!"
"338" "LUKE" "I see them. Wait, Leia!"
"339" "LUKE" "Quick! Block their comlink. Central switch!"
"340" "HAN" "Hey, wait! Ahhh !"
"341" "LUKE" "Come closer!"
"342" "LUKE" "Stand next to that one!"
"343" "LUKE" "Take him!"
"344" "LUKE" "Keep it up! I'll take these two!"
"345" "THREEPIO" "Oh, General Solo, someone's coming. Oh!"
"346" "HAN" "Luke! Where's Leia?"
"347" "LUKE" "What? She didn't come back?"
"348" "HAN" "I thought she was with you."
"349" "LUKE" "We split up."
"350" "LUKE" "Hey, we better go look for her."
"351" "HAN" "Take the squad ahead. We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300."
"352" "LUKE" "Come on, Artoo. We're going to need your scanners."
"353" "THREEPIO" "Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do."
"354" "THREEPIO" "And you said it was beautiful here. Ugh!"
"355" "READ" "Stop it!"
"356" "READ" "I won't hurt you."
"357" "READ" "Well, it looks like I'm stuck here. The problem is, I don't know where it is."
"358" "READ" "Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down."
"359" "READ" "I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here."
"360" "READ" "Okay. Do you want something to eat?"
"361" "READ" "That's right. Let's go. Hmmm?"
"362" "READ" "Look, it's a hat. It won't hurt you. Look. You're a nervous little thing, aren't you?"
"363" "READ" "What is it?"
"364" "SCOUT #l" "Freeze! Come on, get up!"
"365" "SCOUT #1" "Go get your ride and take her back to base."
"366" "SCOUT #2" "Yes, sir."
"367" "READ" "Come on, let's get out of here."
"368" "GUARD" "Stop! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at this time."
"369" "VADER" "The Emperor will see me now!"
"370" "GUARD" "The Emperor will see you, now."
"371" "EMPEROR" "I told you to remain on the command ship."
"372" "VADER" "A small rebel force penetrated the shield and landed on Endor."
"373" "EMPEROR" "Yes, I know."
"374" "VADER" "My son is with them."
"375" "EMPEROR" "Are you sure?"
"376" "VADER" "I felt it, my Master."
"377" "EMPEROR" "Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader."
"378" "VADER" "They are clear, my Master."
"379" "EMPEROR" "Then you should go to the Moon Sanctuary and wait for them."
"380" "VADER" "Will he come to me?"
"381" "EMPEROR" "I foresaw it. His compassion for you will be your undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me."
"382" "VADER" "As you wish."
"383" "HAN" "Luke! Luke!"
"384" "THREEPIO" "Oh, Master Luke."
"385" "LUKE" "There are two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this."
"386" "THREEPIO" "I'm afraid Artoo's sensors will find no trace of Princess Leia."
"387" "HAN" "I hope she's okay."
"388" "HAN" "What, Chewie? What? Chewie!"
"390" "HAN" "No, it's just a dead animal, Chewie."
"389" "HAN" "Hey, I don't understand."
"391" "LUKE" "Chewie, wa - wait! No!"
"392" "HAN" "Good job. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach."
"393" "LUKE" "Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber?"
"394" "HAN" "Yes, of course."
"395" "THREEPIO" "Artoo, I'm not sure this is a good idea. It's a really long dro -o -op!!"
"396" "HAN" " What...? Hey! Point that thing somewhere else."
"397" "HAN" "Hey!"
"398" "LUKE" "Han, don't do that. It'll be okay."
"399" "LUKE" "Chewie, give them your crossbow."
"400" "THREEPIO" "Oh, my head. Oh, my God!"
"401" "LUKE" "Do you understand anything they're saying?"
"402" "THREEPIO" "Ah yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication."
"403" "HAN" "What are you telling them?"
"404" "THREEPIO" "Hello, I think... I may be mistaken. They are using a very primitive dialect. But I believe they think I am some kind of god."
"405" "HAN" "Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?"
"406" "THREEPIO" "I apologize, General Solo, but that would not be appropriate."
"407" "HAN" "Appropriate?!"
"408" "THREEPIO" "It is against my programming to impersonate a deity."
"409" "HAN" "Why, you--"
"410" "HAN" "My mistake. He's an old friend of mine."
"411" "HAN" "I have a bad feeling about this."
"412" "HAN" "What did he say?"
"413" "THREEPIO" "I'm quite embarrassed, General Solo, but it looks like you'll be the main course at a banquet in my honor."
"414" "HAN and LUKE" "Read!"
"415" "READ" "Ah!"
"416" "THREEPIO" "Your Royal Highness."
"417" "READ" "But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be freed."
"418" "HAN" "Somehow, I got the feeling it didn't help us much."
"419" "LUKE" "Threepio, tell them that if they don't do what you want, you will get angry and use your magic."
"420" "THREEPIO" "But Master Luke, what magic?"
"421" "LUKE" "Just tell them."
"422" "THREEPIO" "You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just..."
"423" "THREEPIO" "...like I said they wouldn't. What - what - what's going on! Oh! Oh dear! Oh!”
"424" "THREEPIO" "Put me down! Ee- elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Someone, someone, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quick! Do something, someone! Oh! Ohhh!"
"425" "THREEPIO" "Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank God."
"426" "LUKE" "Thanks, Threepio."
"427" "THREEPIO" "I... I never knew I had it in me."
"428" "THREEPIO" "Yes, Artoo. I was just getting there."
"429" "HAN" "What's going on?"
"430" "READ" "I don't know."
"431" "THREEPIO" "Wonderful! We are now part of the tribe."
"432" "HAN" "Exactly what I always wanted."
"433" "HAN" "Well, a short help is better than no help, Chewie. Thanks. Okay."
"434" "THREEPIO" "He says the scouts will show us the quickest way to the shield generator."
"435" "HAN" "Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some new supplies too. And try to get our weapons back."
"436" "HAN" "And hurry up, will you? I don't have all day."
"437" "LUKE" "Luke, what's wrong?"
"438" "LUKE" "Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?"
"439" "READ" "Just a little. She died when I was very young."
"440" "LUKE" "What do you remember?"
"441" "READ" "Just... images, really. Feelings."
"442" "LUKE" "Tell me."
"443" "LEIA" "She was very beautiful. Kind, but... sad. Why are you asking me all this?"
"444" "LUKE" "I don't remember my mother. I never met her."
"445" "READ" "Luke, tell me. What's bothering you?"
"446" "LUKE" "Vader is here... now, on this moon."
"447" "READ" "How do you know?"
"448" "LUKE" "I felt his presence. He came for me. He can sense when I'm close. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm putting the group and our mission here at risk. I have to face him."
"449" "READ" "Why?"
"450" ​​"LUKE" "He's my father."
"451" "READ" "Your father?"
"452" "LUKE" "There is more. It won't be easy for you to hear, but you must. If I don't return, you are the only hope for the Alliance."
"453" "READ" "Luke, don't talk like that. You have a power that I... I don't understand and could never have."
"454" "LUKE" "You're wrong, Leia. You have this power too. In time you'll learn to use it like I do. The Force runs strong in my family. My father has... I have. it. .. and... my sister has it."
"455" "LUKE" "Yes. It's you Leia."
"456" "READ" "I know. Somehow... I always knew."
"457" "LUKE" "Then you know why I have to face him."
"458" "READ" "No! Luke, run away. If he can sense your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you."
"459" "LUKE" "No, not you. You've always been strong."
"460" "READ" "But why must you confront him?"
"461" "LUKE" "Because... there's something good in him. I felt it. He won't hand me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can bring him back to the good side. I have to try. "
"462" "HAN" "Hey, what's going on?"
"463" "READ" "Nothing. I - I just want to be alone for a while."
"464" "HAN" "Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's going on?"
"465" "READ" "I... I can't tell you."
"466" "HAN" "Did you tell Luke? Is that what you could tell?"
"467" "READ" "I..."
"468" "HAN" "Ahhh..."
"469" "HAN" "I'm sorry."
"470" "READ" "Hold me."
"471" "COMMANDER" "This is a rebel who has surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a new search of the area."
"472" "COMMANDER" "He was armed with just that."
"473" "VADER" "Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring your companions to me."
"474" "COMMANDER" "Yes, my Lord."
"475" "VADER" "The Emperor was waiting for you."
"476" "LUKE" "I know, Dad."
"477" "VADER" "So, you have accepted the truth."
"478" "LUKE" "I have accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father."
"479" "VADER" "That name no longer has any meaning to me."
"480" "LUKE" "It's the name of your true self. You just forgot. I know there's something good in you. The Emperor hasn't completely taken it away from you. That's why you can't destroy me. . It's That's why you won't take me to your emperor now."
"481" "VADER" "I see you built a new lightsaber."
"482" "VADER" "Your abilities are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor predicted."
"483" "LUKE" "Come with me."
"484" "VADER" "Obi-Wan once thought like you."
"485" "VADER" "You do not know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master."
"486" "LUKE" "I will not turn... and you will be forced to kill me."
"487" "VADER" "If that is your destiny."
"488" "LUKE" "Search your feelings, father. You can't do that. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hatred."
"489" "VADER" "It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now."
"490" "LUKE" "So my father is really dead."
"491" "READ" "The main entrance to the control bunker is on the other side of the landing pad. This isn't going to be easy."
"492" "HAN" "Hey, don't worry. Chewie and I have gotten into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this."
"493" "READ" "What is he saying?"
"494" "THREEPIO" "He says there is a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge."
"495" "LANDO" "Admiral, we are in position. All fighters have been accounted for."
"496" "ACKBAR" "Continue countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates."
"497" "LANDO" "Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll take down the shield in time... or this will be the shortest offensive ever."
"498" "ACKBAR" "All ships, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark."
"499" "LANDO" "Okay. Wait."
"500" "HAN" "Back door, huh? Good idea."
"501" "HAN" "It's just a few guards. It shouldn't be much of a problem."
"502" "READ" "Well, it only takes one to raise the alarm."
"503" "HAN" "Then let's do it very quietly."
"504" "THREEPIO" "Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!"
"505" "READ" "Silent."
"506" "THREEPIO" "I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash."
"507" "READ" "Oh no."
"508" "HAN" "There goes our surprise attack."
"509" "SCOUT" "Look! Over there! Stop him!"
"510" "HAN" "Not bad for a little furball. Only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of it."
"511" "THREEPIO" "I've decided we're going to stay here."
"512" "EMPEROR" "Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been waiting for you."
"513" "EMPEROR" "You don't need this anymore."
"514" "EMPEROR" "Guards, leave us."
"515" "EMPEROR" "I look forward to completing your training. In time you will call me Master."
"516" "LUKE" "You are gravely mistaken. You will not convert me like you did my father."
"517" "EMPEROR" "Ah, no, my young Jedi. You will discover that it is you who are mistaken... about many things."
"518" "VADER" "Your lightsaber."
"519" "EMPEROR" "Ah yes, a Jedi weapon. Much like your father's. By now you should know that your father can never be turned from the dark side. So it will be with you."
"520" "LUKE" "You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead... and you with me."
"521" "EMPEROR" "Perhaps you mean the imminent attack by your Rebel fleet."
"522" "EMPEROR" "Yes... I assure you that we are safe from your friends here."
"523" "LUKE" "Your overconfidence is your weakness."
"524" "EMPEROR" "Your faith in your friends is yours."
"525" "VADER" "It's useless to resist, my son."
"526" "EMPEROR" "Everything that happened was done according to my design. Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon..."
"527" "EMPEROR" "... are walking into a trap. Just like your Rebel fleet! I was the one who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. A legion of my best troops awaits them."
"528" "EMPEROR" "Ah... I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational by the time your friends arrive."
"529" "HAN" "Alright! Up! Move! Come on! Quick! Quick, Chewie."
"530" "READ" "Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment."
"531" "HAN" "Charges! Come on, come on!"
"532" "THREEPIO" "Oh, my! They will be captured!"
"533" "THREEPIO" " Wa -wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me."
"534" "COMMANDER" "Stop! You rebel scum."
"535" "LANDO" "All wards report."
"536" "WEDGE" "Red Leader standing by."
"537" "GRAY LEADER" "Gray Leader standing by."
"538" "GREEN LEADER" "Green Leader standing by."
"539" "WEDGE" "Block S-foils in attack positions."
"540" "ACKBAR" "May the Force be with us."
"541" "LANDO" "We have to get some kind of reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how can they be hindering us if they don't know if we're coming."
"542" "LANDO" "Cut off the attack! The shield is still up."
"543" "RED LEADER" "I can't read it. Are you sure?"
"544" "LANDO" "Pull up! All vessels stop!"
"545" "ACKBAR" "Take evasive action! Green Group, stay near sector MV-7."
"546" "CONTROLLER" "Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47."
"547" "ACKBAR" "It's a trap!"
"548" "LANDO" "Fighters arriving."
"549" "REBEL PILOT" "There are too many of them!"
"550" "LANDO" "Accelerate to attack speed! Draw fire away from the cruisers."
"551" "CUNHA" "Copy, Gold Leader."
"552" "EMPEROR" "Come, boy. See for yourself."
"553" "EMPEROR" "From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance and the end of your petty Rebellion."
"554" "EMPEROR" "You want this, don't you? Hatred is growing in you now. Take your Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Hit me with it. Give in to your anger. With each passing moment , you become more of my servant."
"555" "LUKE" "No!"
"556" "EMPEROR" "It is inevitable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now mine!"
"557" "STORMTROOPER" "Alright, move! I said move! Go ahead!"
"558" "THREEPIO" "Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?"
"559" "BUNKER COMMANDER" "Get these two down here!"
"560" "STORMTROOPER" "Let's go!"
"561" "THREEPIO" "Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure that was a good idea?"
"562" "STORMTROOPER" "Freeze! Don't move!"
"563" "THREEPIO" "We surrender."
"564" "THREEPIO" "Ohhh! Back off, Artoo."
"565" "READ" "The code has changed. We need Artoo!"
"566" "HAN" "Here is the terminal."
"567" "READ" "Artoo, where are you? We need you in the bunker immediately."
"568" "THREEPIO" "Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroism. Come back!"
"569" "LANDO" "Watch out, Wedge! Three from the top!"
"570" "WEDGE" "Red Three, Red Two, pull!"
"571" "RED TWO" "Got it!"
"572" "RED THREE" "Three of them coming, twenty degrees!"
"573" "WEDGE" "Cut to the left! I'll get the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate."
"574" "NAVIGATOR" "Pressure is stable."
"575" "LANDO" "Only the fighters are attacking. I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for."
"576" "COMMANDER" "We are in attack position now, sir."
"577" "PIETT" "Wait here."
"578" "COMMANDER" "Are we not going to attack?"
"579" "PIETT" "I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special planned for them. We just need to stop them from escaping."
"580" "EMPEROR" "As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station. Fire at will, Commander."
"581" "JERJERROD" "Fire!"
"582" "LANDO" "That explosion came from the Death Star! That thing is operational! Home One, this is the Gold Leader."
"583" "ACKBAR" "We saw it. All ships prepare to retreat."
"584" "LANDO" "You won't get another chance at this, Admiral."
"585" "ACKBAR" "We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers cannot repel firepower of this magnitude."
"586" "LANDO" "Han will have that shield down. We have to give him more time."
"587" "THREEPIO" "We're coming!"
"588" "HAN" "Come on! Come on!"
"589" "THREEPIO" "Oh, Artoo, quick!"
"590" "THREEPIO" "My God! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?"
"591" "HAN" "Well, I suppose I could turn this thing on."
"592" "READ" "I've got your back."
"593" "LANDO" "Yes! I said closer! Get as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point blank range."
"594" "ACKBAR" "At this range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers."
"595" "LANDO" "We'll outlast the Death Star... and we can take some of them with us."
"596" "REBEL PILOT" "She's going to explode!"
"597" "Y-WING PILOT" "I've been hit!"
"598" "EMPEROR" "Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the moon of Endor will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die... as will your friends."
"599" "EMPEROR" "Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless. Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hate, and your journey to the dark side will be complete."
"600" "WALKER PILOT #1" "Look!"
"601" "PILOT #2" "Get him out of there!"
"602" "HAN" "I think I got it. I did it!"
"603" "THREEPIO" "Oh, Princess Leia, are you okay?"
"604" "HAN" "Let's see."
"605" "READ" "Not bad."
"606" "STORMTROOPER" "Freeze!"
"607" "THREEPIO" "Oh, honey."
"608" "STORMTROOPER" "Don't move!"
"609" "HAN" "I love you."
"610" "READ" "I know."
"611" "STORMTROOPER" "Hands up! Get up!"
"612" "HAN" "Stay back."
"613" "HAN" "Chewie! Get down here! She's hurt! No, wait... I have an idea."
"614" "EMPEROR" "Good. Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you."
"615" "VADER" "Obi-Wan taught you well."
"616" "LUKE" "I'm not going to fight you, dad."
"617" "VADER" "You are reckless in lowering your defenses."
"618" "LUKE" "Your thoughts betray you, father. I sense the good in you... the conflict."
"619" "VADER" "There is no conflict."
"620" "LUKE" "You couldn't kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now."
"621" "VADER" "You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you do not fight, then you will meet your fate."
"622" "EMPEROR" "Good. Good."
"623" "LANDO" "Careful. Squadron at 0.06."
"624" "REBEL PILOT" "I'm on it, Gold Leader."
"625" "CUNHA" "Good shot, Red Two."
"626" "LANDO" "Now... come on, Han, old friend. Don't disappoint me."
"627" "HAN/PILOT" "It's over, Commander. The rebels have been defeated. They are fleeing into the forest. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit."
"628" "CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER" "Send three squads to help. Open the back door."
"629" "SECOND COMMANDER" "Yes, sir."
"630" "HAN" "Throw me another load."
"631" "VADER" "You can't hide forever, Luke."
"632" "LUKE" "I'm not going to fight you."
"633" "VADER" "Give in to the dark side. It's the only way to save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for..."
"634" "VADER" "Sister! So... you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed you too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you don't transform to the dark side, then maybe she will."
"635" "LUKE" "Never-rr!"
"636" "EMPEROR" "Good! Your hatred has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side!"
"637" "LUKE" "Never! I will never turn to the dark side. You have failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me."
"638" "EMPEROR" "So be it... Jedi."
"639" "HAN" "Move! Move!"
"640" "ACKBAR" "Shield is down! Begin attack on the Death Star's main reactor."
"641" "LANDO" "We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all the fighters follow me. I said they would do it!"
"642" "EMPEROR" "If you are not transformed, you will be destroyed."
"643" "EMPEROR" "Young fool... only now, at the end, do you understand."
"644" "EMPEROR" "Your weak abilities are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision."
"645" "LUKE" "Dad, please. Help me."
"646" "EMPEROR" "Now, young Skywalker... you are going to die."
"647" "CUNHA" "I'm going in."
"648" "LANDO" "Here goes nothing."
"649" "LANDO" "Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator."
"650" "WEDGE" "Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space very quickly."
"651" "LANDO" "Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get some of those TIE fighters to follow you."
"652" "PILOT" "Copy, Gold Leader."
"653" "LANDO" "That was really close."
"654" "ACKBAR" "We have to give those fighters more time. Focus all fire on that Super Star Destroyer."
"655" "CONTROLLER" "Sir, we have lost our bridge deflector shield."
"656" "PIETT" "Increase the front batteries. I don't want anything to get through."
"657" "PIETT" "Intensify forward firepower!"
"658" "COMMANDER" "It's too late!"
"659" "VADER" "Luke, help me take off this mask."
"660" "LURE" "But you're going to die."
"661" "VADER" "Nothing can stop this now. Just for once... let me look at you with my own eyes."
"662" "ANAKIN" "Now... go, my son. Leave me."
"663" "LUKE" "No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I have to save you."
"664" "ANAKIN" "You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister... you were right."
"665" "LUKE" "Dad... I won't leave you."
"666" "CUNHA" "There it is!"
"667" "LANDO" "Alright, Wedge. Go to the power regulator in the north tower."
"668" "WEDGE" "Copy, Gold Leader. I'm leaving now."
"669" "ACKBAR" "Move the fleet away from the Death Star."
"670" "LANDO" "Cunha, I don't think we're going to make it."
"671" "WEDGE" "You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader."
"672" "LANDO" "I promised to return the ship without a scratch... I hope that old pirate forgives me."
"673" "HAN" "Lando..."
"674" "THREEPIO" "They did it!"
